# release-plz.yml - Automated versioning and GitHub releases
#
# How it works:
# 1. Push to main with conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:)
# 2. release-plz creates a "Release PR" with version bump + changelog
# 3. Merge the Release PR -> GitHub Release created automatically
#
# Conventional commit prefixes:
# - feat: -> minor version bump (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0)
# - fix:  -> patch version bump (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
# - docs: -> no version bump (changelog only)
# - BREAKING CHANGE: -> major version bump (0.1.0 -> 1.0.0)
#
# Note: crates.io publishing is disabled in release-plz.toml
