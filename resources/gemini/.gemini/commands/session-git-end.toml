End and archive the current Patina session with Git work classification:

1. Execute the session end script:
   `.gemini/bin/session-git-end.sh`

2. Review the session classification:
   - EXPLORATION: No commits made
   - PATTERN-WORK: Modified patterns/documentation
   - MAJOR-FEATURE: Many files changed
   - EXPERIMENT: Few commits
   - FEATURE: Normal work

3. The session has been archived to:
   - `.gemini/context/sessions/[session-id].md`
   - `layer/sessions/[session-id].md`

4. Session is preserved via Git tags: `session-[id]-start..session-[id]-end`
   - View work: `git log session-[id]-start..session-[id]-end`
   - Diff: `git diff session-[id]-start..session-[id]-end`

5. Ask the user if they'd like to:
   - Review the session summary
   - Cherry-pick commits to main
   - Start a new session

The session work is now preserved in both the project history and Git tags.
