Add a note to the current Patina session with Git context:

1. Execute the session note script:
   `.gemini/bin/session-git-note.sh {{args}}`

2. The note has been added to `.gemini/context/active-session.md` with the current Git branch and commit SHA

Notes with Git context become searchable memory - future sessions can find "when did we solve X?"
