End and archive the current Patina session:

1. Execute the session end script:
   `.gemini/bin/session-end.sh`

2. The session has been archived to:
   - `.gemini/context/sessions/[session-id].md`
   - `layer/sessions/[session-id].md`

3. `last-session.md` has been updated with a pointer to this session

4. Ask the user if they'd like to:
   - Review the session summary
   - Commit any remaining changes
   - Start a new session

The session work is now preserved in the project history.
