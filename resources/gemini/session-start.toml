Start a new Patina development session:

1. Execute the session start command:
   `patina session start "{{args}}"`

2. Read `.patina/local/last-session.md` if it exists and use it to fill in the "Previous Session Context" section in the active session file. Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of what was accomplished and any open items.

3. Read the newly created `.patina/local/active-session.md` file

4. If we've been discussing work already in this conversation:
   - Update the Goals section with specific tasks we've identified
   - Add context about why this session was started
   - Note any decisions or constraints we've discussed

5. Ask the user: "Would you like me to create todos for '{{args}}'?"

6. Remind the user about session workflow:
   - Use `/session-update` periodically to capture progress
   - Use `/session-note` for important insights
   - End with `/session-end` to archive and distill learnings

The session is now tracking both code changes and our conversation context.
