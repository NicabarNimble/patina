Update the current Patina session:

1. Execute the session update command:
   `patina session update`

2. Read the updated `.patina/local/active-session.md` file

3. Fill in the update section with:
   - Work completed since last update
   - Key decisions and reasoning
   - Challenges faced and solutions
   - Patterns observed

4. **Check for beliefs to capture**: Any design decisions, repeated patterns, strong principles, or lessons learned? If yes, suggest: "This sounds like a belief worth capturing. Should I create it?"

5. If there are uncommitted changes, remind the user about git best practices:
   - Make small, focused commits
   - Each commit should have ONE clear purpose
   - Use `git add -p` for surgical staging

The session update has been recorded.
