# Embedding Model Registry
# Defines available models for Patina's semantic search
#
# **PLATFORM CONSTRAINT: Mac-First (Apple Silicon)**
# - Patina targets macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
# - Models should leverage Metal GPU + Neural Engine
# - ONNX Runtime uses CoreML execution provider (NOT CUDA)
# - Prefer ONNX models with good CoreML performance
