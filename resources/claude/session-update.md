Mark something interesting in the current Patina session:

1. Run the session update script:
   - Execute: `!.claude/bin/session-update.sh "$ARGUMENTS"`

2. Confirm what was marked:
   - Say: "Noted: [what user said]"
   
3. Do NOT:
   - Add analysis
   - Generate code
   - Create files
   - Elaborate on the mark
   - Ask questions

Note: This is simply capturing what you find interesting during work. Intelligence happens at session end.
