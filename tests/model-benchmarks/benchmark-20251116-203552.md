# Embedding Model Benchmark
**Date**: Sun Nov 16 20:35:52 EST 2025
**Queries**: 5
**Models**: 5

## Model: all-minilm-l6-v2
**Average Similarity**: .4965

### Query 1: "when should i extract code to a module?"
**Top Result**: Extract module when it has single clear responsibility, exceeds 150 LOC in external interface, or has 3+ distinct concerns. Signal for extraction: multiple impl blocks, unclear naming, or and in module name. (sim: 0.60072553)

### Query 2: "how do i handle errors in this project?"
**Top Result**: Provide single Error enum per module, mark as non_exhaustive if variants may grow. Export from mod.rs, implement in internal.rs. Makes error handling predictable and documentation clear. (sim: 0.43468857)

### Query 3: "when is optimization premature?"
**Top Result**: Build core value proposition (Ingest → Structure → Retrieve) before optimizing for performance (sim: 0.40212518)

### Query 4: "concurrency problems with sqlite"
**Top Result**: SQLite Connection uses RefCell internally and is not Sync - cannot be shared across threads with Arc<RwLock> (sim: 0.59114933)

### Query 5: "how should i prioritize what to build first?"
**Top Result**: Build core value proposition (Ingest → Structure → Retrieve) before optimizing for performance (sim: 0.4542395)

## Model: bge-small-en-v1-5
**Average Similarity**: .6758

### Query 1: "when should i extract code to a module?"
**Top Result**: Extract to internal.rs or internal/ folder when: module exceeds 150 lines, has complex implementation logic, or needs multiple helper functions. Keep external interface stable and small. (sim: 0.73703545)

### Query 2: "how do i handle errors in this project?"
**Top Result**: Ask "Are we solving the wrong problem?" when hitting unexpected technical constraints - may indicate invented requirements (sim: 0.6331767)

### Query 3: "when is optimization premature?"
**Top Result**: Build core value proposition (Ingest → Structure → Retrieve) before optimizing for performance (sim: 0.62658656)

### Query 4: "concurrency problems with sqlite"
**Top Result**: SQLite Connection uses RefCell internally and is not Sync - cannot be shared across threads with Arc<RwLock> (sim: 0.7269647)

### Query 5: "how should i prioritize what to build first?"
**Top Result**: Build core value proposition (Ingest → Structure → Retrieve) before optimizing for performance (sim: 0.65563595)

**Average Similarity**: .7069

### Query 1: "when should i extract code to a module?"
**Top Result**: Extract to internal.rs or internal/ folder when: module exceeds 150 lines, has complex implementation logic, or needs multiple helper functions. Keep external interface stable and small. (sim: 0.7547089)

### Query 2: "how do i handle errors in this project?"
**Top Result**: Provide single Error enum per module, mark as non_exhaustive if variants may grow. Export from mod.rs, implement in internal.rs. Makes error handling predictable and documentation clear. (sim: 0.68160474)

### Query 3: "when is optimization premature?"
**Top Result**: Ask "Are we solving the wrong problem?" when hitting unexpected technical constraints - may indicate invented requirements (sim: 0.6674621)

### Query 4: "concurrency problems with sqlite"
**Top Result**: SQLite Connection uses RefCell internally and is not Sync - cannot be shared across threads with Arc<RwLock> (sim: 0.773563)

### Query 5: "how should i prioritize what to build first?"
**Top Result**: Build core value proposition (Ingest → Structure → Retrieve) before optimizing for performance (sim: 0.6576053)

## Model: e5-base-v2
**Average Similarity**: .8345

### Query 1: "when should i extract code to a module?"
**Top Result**: Extract to internal.rs or internal/ folder when: module exceeds 150 lines, has complex implementation logic, or needs multiple helper functions. Keep external interface stable and small. (sim: 0.8525647)

### Query 2: "how do i handle errors in this project?"
**Top Result**: Provide single Error enum per module, mark as non_exhaustive if variants may grow. Export from mod.rs, implement in internal.rs. Makes error handling predictable and documentation clear. (sim: 0.82388866)

### Query 3: "when is optimization premature?"
**Top Result**: Profile before adding daemon infrastructure - 500ms embeddings load may not require optimization (sim: 0.80312055)

### Query 4: "concurrency problems with sqlite"
**Top Result**: SQLite Connection uses RefCell internally and is not Sync - cannot be shared across threads with Arc<RwLock> (sim: 0.8612604)

### Query 5: "how should i prioritize what to build first?"
**Top Result**: Build core value proposition (Ingest → Structure → Retrieve) before optimizing for performance (sim: 0.83202153)
