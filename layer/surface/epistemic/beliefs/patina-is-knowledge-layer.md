# patina-is-knowledge-layer

Patina is a git-style knowledge layer, not an LLM tool competitor — like git doesn't compete with editors, Patina doesn't compete with Claude Code or OpenCode; it's the local-first knowledge substrate they reach into via MCP.

## Statement

Patina is a git-style knowledge layer, not an LLM tool competitor — like git doesn't compete with editors, Patina doesn't compete with Claude Code or OpenCode; it's the local-first knowledge substrate they reach into via MCP.

## Evidence

- [[session-20260204-163132]]: [[session-20260204-163132]] - Strategic analysis comparing Claude Code memory (241MB raw JSONL) vs Patina sessions (curated markdown). Confirmed Patina's role is substrate not competitor. (weight: 0.95)
