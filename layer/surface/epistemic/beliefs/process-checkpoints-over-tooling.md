# process-checkpoints-over-tooling

Process checkpoints catch what tooling alone misses. Having the right tool isn't enough - workflow must include moments to use it. A skill that exists but never triggers is useless.

## Statement

Process checkpoints catch what tooling alone misses. Having the right tool isn't enough - workflow must include moments to use it. A skill that exists but never triggers is useless.
