## What Releases Would Have Been

If release-plz had been working from the start, based on conventional commits:

| Hypothetical Version | Timing | Milestone |
|---------------------|--------|-----------|
| 0.1.0 | Sep 2025 | Language support working, CI stable |
| 0.2.0 | Oct 2025 | Dagger removed, clean architecture |
| 0.3.0 | Nov 2025 | MCP tools, serve command |
| 0.4.0 | Dec 2025 | Mother, secrets, release automation |
| 0.5.0+ | Jan 2026 | Beliefs in scry, go-public prep |

**Reality:** All of this shipped as v0.1.0 on Jan 17, 2026.

---

## Post v0.1.0 Analysis

**Commits since v0.1.0:** 494 (38 days, ~13/day)
**feat commits:** 117
**fix commits:** 44

### Notable Features Since v0.1.0
- `9aeceff3` feat(scry): beliefs in semantic search (E3)
- `ab454d93` feat(launch): auto-configure MCP
- `1df7ecce` feat: vocabulary gap bridging
- `aaf36b60` refactor(mother): mothership竊知other rename
- `1cfaeff5` refactor: remove dev_env subsystem (~435 lines)
- Mother graph learning, database identity, forge sync

**If release-plz worked:** With 117 feat commits over 38 days, this would be approximately v0.3.0+ by now (each feat bumps minor version in semver).

---

## Conventional Commit Analysis

### Pre-v0.1.0 (6 months)
Commits were mostly conventional, with custom prefixes:
- Standard: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `test:`
- Custom (valid): `spec:`, `belief:`, `session:`, `style:`

### Non-Conventional Patterns Found
- `WIP:` commits (work in progress)
- `Merge pull request` (GitHub auto)
- Some early commits without prefixes

**Assessment:** History is clean enough. Conventional commits were used consistently from ~August 2025 onward.

---

## Clean Start Point Analysis

### Option A: Start from v0.1.0 (Recommended)
- **Pros:** It's the tagged release, clean starting point
- **Cons:** All pre-release history (5 months) undocumented in CHANGELOG
- **Version now:** Should be ~0.2.0 or 0.3.0 based on feat count (117 feats in 38 days)

### Option B: Retroactive tagging from Oct 2025
- **Pros:** Captures the Dagger-removal milestone
- **Cons:** Requires retroactive tags, more work, less clean

### Option C: Start at 1.0.0 (going public = stable)
- **Pros:** Bold statement, clean slate
- **Cons:** Implies stability we may not have

---

## Recommendation

**Start from v0.1.0** but acknowledge the history:

1. **CHANGELOG.md** should have a "Pre-release History" section pointing to:
   - This audit document
   - The session archives in `layer/sessions/`
   - Key milestone commits listed above

2. **Current version** should be bumped to reflect work since v0.1.0:
   - 117 feat commits = significant minor version bump
   - Suggest: v0.2.0 or v0.3.0 as "going public" version

3. **Going forward:** Fix release-plz so versions increment properly

---

## Release-plz Status

**Current state:** Broken (9 failed runs)
**Root cause:** Gitignored files that were previously tracked cause "uncommitted changes" error
**Fix exists:** Commit `036e9c64` untracked problematic files, but issue persists

**Files causing issues:**
- `layer/dust/` (archived patterns)
- `.patina/config.toml`, `.patina/oxidize.yaml` (project-specific)

**Decision needed:** Fix release-plz or adopt alternative (git-cliff + manual)?

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| When does history become meaningful? | August 2025 (black-box refactor, conventional commits consistent) |
| What would releases have been? | ~5 versions: 0.1.0 through 0.5.0 |
| What version to start fresh at? | v0.1.0 exists, bump to v0.2.0+ for go-public |
| Where's the historical record? | This audit + session archives |

---

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Decide: fix release-plz or use alternative
2. [ ] Decide: what version for go-public (0.2.0? 0.3.0? 1.0.0?)
3. [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md with pre-release history section
4. [ ] Bump Cargo.toml version
5. [ ] Tag and release
