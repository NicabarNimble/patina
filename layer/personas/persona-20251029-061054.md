# Persona Session
**ID**: persona-20251029-061054
**Started**: 2025-10-29T10:10:54Z
**Database**: .patina/db/facts.db

## Goal
Discover and codify your beliefs through interactive dialogue.

## Available Tools

### Query Observations (SQLite)
```bash
sqlite3 .patina/db/facts.db "SELECT * FROM patterns WHERE category = 'architecture'"
sqlite3 .patina/db/facts.db "SELECT * FROM sessions ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 5"
```

### Query with Prolog (Future)
```bash
scryer-prolog .patina/rules.pl -g "needs_codification(Pattern, Domain)"
```

## Session Flow

1. **Domain Selection**: Analyze recent work, pick active domain
2. **Gap Detection**: Find observations not yet codified as beliefs
3. **Evidence Search**: Search ALL history for supporting/contradicting evidence
4. **Question Generation**: Create ONE atomic yes/no question
5. **User Answers**: Capture answer (yes/no/conditional)
6. **Contradiction Resolution**: If conditional, generate refined questions
7. **Codify Belief**: Store in beliefs table with citations
8. **Repeat**: Next gap → next question

## Remember

- ONE question at a time (not a checklist)
- Your answer + observations inform NEXT question
- LLM does heavy lifting (search, synthesis, gap detection)
- Feels like discovery, not interrogation
- Evidence-based: every belief links to sessions

## Summary

**Beliefs Created**: 22 beliefs across 5 domains

**Domains Explored**:
- **Architecture** (6 beliefs): Unix-style focused tools, consistent patterns at all scales, stable interfaces with replaceable cores, platform longevity
- **Security** (5 beliefs): Never commit secrets, 1Password preference, AI code requires guidance and safeguards, summary-based manual review
- **Development Workflow** (5 beliefs): Mac-centric with Docker when appropriate, Patina integration branch strategy, small focused commits, strict automated quality checks
- **Technology Choices** (3 beliefs): Statically-typed compiled languages, queryable knowledge systems, structured data as canonical source
- **Philosophy** (3 beliefs): Decisions grounded in evolving beliefs, escape hatches without over-engineering, no preference for public repos for CI

**Key Insights**:
- Strong consistency principle: same architectural patterns regardless of scale (tools vs systems)
- Black-box philosophy: "stable interfaces, replaceable cores, code that lasts longer than platforms"
- Meta-belief about decision-making: "decisions are based on beliefs, those beliefs evolve over time"
- Balance between pragmatism and principle: escape hatches are good but shouldn't lead to over-engineering

**Patterns**:
- High confidence (0.95) on core architectural and security beliefs
- Lower confidence (0.80-0.85) on environmental choices (Mac, Docker) - these are contextual
- Evidence-based: each belief traced to specific sessions and decisions

**Open Questions**:
- Pattern-polymorphism decision needs updating: originally noted "different patterns for tools vs systems" but belief shows opposite
- Several exploration sessions had 0 commits - correlation, not causation
- Docker usage is conditional ("when project fits") - may need refinement as projects evolve
