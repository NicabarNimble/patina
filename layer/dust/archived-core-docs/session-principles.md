# Session Principles

## Core Philosophy
Development sessions contain valuable context that should be captured, processed, and stored for future reference.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Capture Without Friction
- System handles all mechanical work
- Developer focuses on development
- Documentation emerges from work
- No manual bookkeeping required

### 2. Time as Foundation
- Timestamps are natural identifiers
- Chronological order preserves context
- Time spans show work progression
- Scripts own temporal accuracy

### 3. Separation of Concerns
- **Capture**: Simple, fast, reliable
- **Processing**: Intelligent, async, rich
- **Storage**: Organized, searchable, permanent
- **Retrieval**: Contextual, relevant, quick

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
- Start with what works
- Enhance without breaking
- Complexity is optional
- Simple path always available

### 5. Human-AI Partnership
- Scripts do mechanical work
- AI provides intelligence
- Human supplies judgment
- System enables collaboration

## Quality Principles

### Signal Over Noise
- Capture what matters
- Focus on decisions and why
- Include problems and solutions
- Preserve learning moments

### Context Preservation
- Today's work is tomorrow's context
- Include enough detail for understanding
- Link changes to rationale
- Maintain narrative continuity

### Evolution Through Use
- Patterns emerge from sessions
- Knowledge compounds over time
- Successful patterns propagate
- System improves through practice
