## Previous Session Context
Last session "Spec reorg review and state of union on patina" completed **E3 (beliefs in scry)** - the major missing piece of the epistemic layer. Added a new beliefs scraper module (~300 lines), integrated beliefs into the oxidize/scry pipeline with ID offset 4B, and verified semantic search returns beliefs (e.g., `patina scry "async"` surfaces the `sync-first` belief at 0.853). Also captured a new belief `read-code-before-write` (confidence 0.88). The session included a deep "state of union" analysis identifying 6 active specs, 18 deferred, and 46 archived.

Session initialized with goal: interesting challenges around opensource slop contributions and how patina could help

### 06:03 - Update (covering since 05:08)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 2
- Files changed: 3 (SPEC.md, design.md, archived session)
- Last commit: spec(explore): signal over noise - anti-slop defense

**Work Completed:**
1. **Problem framing discussion** - Explored "Git Blame for Intent" thesis: the core failure in open source isn't AI-generated code, it's unattributed intent and context-free contributions
2. **Created exploration spec** - `layer/surface/build/explore/anti-slop/` with SPEC.md and design.md
3. **Reframed from "anti-slop" to "signal over noise"** - Expanded scope beyond code PRs to all surfaces (issues, discussions, docs)
4. **Defined integration model** - Patina as local quality layer between frontends (Claude Code) and backends (GitHub/GitLab/Gitea)
5. **Articulated trust layer thesis** - Empirical track record over cryptographic proof; dogfood → evidence → reputation → adoption flywheel

**Key Decisions:**
- **explore/ type spec** - This is research/uncertain outcome, not a feature yet
- **Folder format with SPEC.md** - Following new spec system pattern
- **Deferred ZK/crypto approaches** - Interesting but out of scope; requires infrastructure Patina doesn't control
- **Mac-centric acceptable** - Worth the tradeoff for shipping excellent on one platform

**Discussion Highlights:**
- Intent can be fabricated; process verification necessary but not sufficient
- Only outcomes over time are genuinely hard to fake
- Patina already indexes issues - same signal/noise problem applies there
- "Noise is generic. Signal engages with project-specific knowledge."

**Patterns Observed:**
- Spec-first exploration surfaces assumptions before building
- Folder format keeps related docs together (SPEC.md + design.md)
- Reframing problems positively ("signal over noise" vs "anti-slop") clarifies value prop


### 08:18 - Update (covering since 06:03)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 8 total
- Last commit: docs: update build.md with E3 completion and anti-slop exploration

**Work Completed:**
1. **Created signal-over-noise belief** - Core principle captured (confidence 0.82)
2. **Reframed to "linkage as signal"** - The signal IS the connection between spec→session→commit→code
3. **Reality check on codebase** - Audited actual code vs spec claims
   - EXISTS: `find_session_for_commit()` links commits to sessions by timestamp
   - EXISTS: `session_id` stored in eventlog JSON
   - GAP: No spec→code mapping, no commit message parsing for "Implements:"
4. **Added linkage graph diagrams** - Visual current state vs target state
5. **Defined build roadmap** - ~500-1000 lines needed for linkage measurement
6. **Updated build.md** - Reflected E3 completion, added anti-slop exploration

**Key Decisions:**
- **Linkage over detection** - Don't build bots/CI tools; measure linkage quality
- **Discipline layer works today** - Conventions (spec frontmatter, commit messages) need no code
- **Measurement layer needs code** - Spec coverage table, commit parsing, scry enrichment
- **Session provenance is REAL** - timestamp-based linking already exists

**Commits:**
- `b1034cc3` belief: add signal-over-noise
- `f4405b12` spec(explore): reframe to linkage as signal
- `2beb3e11` spec(explore): add linkage measurement via semantic system
- `ab8a8ed5` spec(explore): reality check - separate EXISTS vs TO BUILD
- `a369025f` spec(explore): add linkage graph diagrams
- `16d66a8c` docs: update build.md with E3 completion and anti-slop exploration

**Patterns Observed:**
- Auditing code before specifying features grounds the spec in reality
- "EXISTS vs TO BUILD" framing clarifies what's vision vs infrastructure
- Demonstrating linkage discipline in commits validates the concept
