## Previous Session Context
The previous session successfully implemented LLM code intelligence pattern detection, restoring real-time pattern detection during AST traversal. Key achievements included detecting naming conventions, architectural layers, and codebase patterns across 147 patterns in the dust repo test, with decisions to focus on statistical patterns for LLM interpretation rather than individual instances.

## Goals
- [ ] context and patina scrape code

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 1
- Last commit: 20 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
- Researched Context7 MCP server and its approach to codebase understanding
- Analyzed current patina scrape implementation (code.rs, pattern detection)
- Explored how Context7 provides version-specific documentation and sample code
- Identified that Context7's real value is storing semantic code examples, not just docs

**Key Decisions:**
- Context7 approach (external API, proprietary) doesn't align with patina's local-first philosophy
- Real insight: Storing exemplar code snippets is more valuable than abstract signatures
- Current patina approach (AST analysis, pattern detection) is solid foundation
- Focus should be on extracting semantic code examples that show real patterns

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Challenge: Context7 requires API calls, not suitable for local-first approach
- Solution: Extract the concept (semantic examples) without the implementation (API)
- Challenge: Current scrape stores too much abstract data (signatures, ASTs)
- Solution: Focus on exemplar functions that demonstrate actual patterns

**Patterns Observed:**
- LLMs need concrete code examples more than abstract signatures
- One good example showing error handling, async, and integration is worth 100 function signatures
- Best examples are stable functions that haven't changed in months
- Entry points and integration functions make the best teaching examples
