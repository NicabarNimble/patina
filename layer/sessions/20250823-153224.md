## Previous Session Context
Last session focused on exploring the scrape-patina-metal-architecture and documenting truth data extraction. The work was classified as exploration, with the primary focus on refactoring the semantic interpretation code to focus exclusively on fact extraction rather than interpretation. This laid the groundwork for more structured language parsing capabilities.

## Goals
- [ ] Add JavaScript/TypeScript language support to patina-metal parser
- [ ] Add Python language support to patina-metal parser
- [ ] Integrate tree-sitter grammars for these languages
- [ ] Update the semantic languages module to support new parsers
- [ ] Test the new language parsers with sample code

### 16:26 - Update (covering since 15:32)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        4
- Files changed: 3
- Last commit: 12 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
- Fixed TypeScript/JavaScript parser initialization that was failing silently
- Parsers were compiling correctly but not being found - issue was already resolved
- Added test utility to verify all parsers (Rust, Go, Solidity, Python, JS, TS) work
- Separated JSX/TSX from JS/TS as distinct language variants for better granularity
- Updated scrape output format to show counts separately (e.g., 55 TS, 6 TSX)
- Successfully tested on dust (206 Solidity, 55 TS, 6 TSX) and dagger (720 Go, 260 TS, 27 TSX, 177 Python)

**Key Decisions:**
- Chose to separate JSX/TSX from JS/TS for clearer codebase composition insights
- Both variants still use same parsers under the hood (JavaScript/TypeScript with JSX flag)
- This helps identify React components (TSX/JSX) vs regular logic files (TS/JS)

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Initial confusion about parser failures - turned out parsers were actually working
- The issue from last session was a misunderstanding - files were being detected correctly

**Patterns Observed:**
- Dagger has SDKs in many languages (PHP, Java, Elixir, C#) we don't yet parse
- TypeScript repos often have clear separation between .ts (logic) and .tsx (UI components)
