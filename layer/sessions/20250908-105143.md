## Previous Session Context
Successfully refactored C/C++/Rust language processors to be fully isolated modules (~400 lines each), removing dependency on the shared LanguageSpec trait system. The refactor maintained exact feature parity while achieving architectural isolation - each processor now operates as a black box with clear input/output boundaries, enabling parallel development and language-specific optimizations. Cairo module already demonstrated this pattern, providing the template for the remaining language migrations.

## Goals
- [ ] Go, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Solidity move out of mod.rs follow c, cpp, rust, and cairo design

**Work completed:**
- Refactored remaining 5 languages (Go, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Solidity) from LanguageSpec trait to isolated processors
- Each language now has a self-contained processor module (~400-600 lines) with its own tree-sitter setup
- Updated mod.rs routing to use isolated processors for all languages
- Cleared out LanguageSpec registry - now empty but kept for backward compatibility

**Key decisions:**
- JavaScript: Single processor handles both .js and .jsx using same parser
- TypeScript: Extracts file extension from FilePath to choose between typescript and tsx parsers
- Solidity: Tracks contract context to generate qualified names (Contract.function)
- Maintained exact git discipline - one commit per language refactoring ("scalpel not shotgun")

**Challenges faced:**
- TypeScript parser complexity: Must detect file extension at runtime to select correct parser variant
- Solidity symbol kinds: Mapped contract-specific concepts (events, state variables) to existing SymbolKind enum
- Each language required careful study of its unique AST patterns and language features

**Patterns observed:**
- Consistent architecture across all processors: setup parser → walk AST → extract symbols → generate SQL
- Languages with similar heritage (JS/TS) share extraction patterns but need distinct visibility/type handling
- The isolation enables parallel development and language-specific optimizations without cross-contamination
