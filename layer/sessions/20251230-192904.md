# Session: spec-llm-frontends
**ID**: 20251230-192904
**Started**: 2025-12-31T00:29:04Z
**LLM**: claude
**Git Branch**: patina
**Session Tag**: session-20251230-192904-start
**Starting Commit**: c9b145e3656c8d7323fa260a658806fb1158094e

## Previous Session Context
Last session transformed spec-llm-frontends.md from a broad "awareness" spec into a focused "integration" spec. Key accomplishments: removed external awareness concerns, focused on 3 interactive frontends (Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI), restructured to separate facts from conclusions, ran 3 stress-test walkthroughs that revealed 12 gaps, then closed all gaps with concrete implementation details (template versioning, adapter sync design, MCP config examples). No commits made - spec rewrite in uncommitted state ready for review.

## Goals
- [ ] Refine spec-llm-frontends - review current spec vs alternative approaches
- [ ] Discuss trade-offs and validate design decisions

### 21:08 - Update (covering since 19:29)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 10
- Last commit: 15 hours ago

**Work Completed:**
- Deep audit of adapter system: discovered Gemini was already fully built (4 scripts, 4 TOML commands)
- Tested `patina init . --llm=gemini` - works, creates full .gemini/ structure
- Identified OpenCode doesn't exist yet (needs to be added)
- Compared Claude vs Gemini templates - scripts are identical except path substitutions
- Completely rewrote spec-llm-frontends.md from 836 lines of over-engineering to 200 lines of actionable reality

**Discussion Context:**
- User asked to anchor in core values (dependable-rust, unix-philosophy, adapter-pattern)
- Analyzed spec against core values - found violations (too much surface area, system not tools)
- Discovered we had already built what the spec was proposing to build (wheel-spinning)
- User identified this as "a break in our system" - patina should prevent this

**Key Decisions:**
1. Unified frontend goal: all 3 frontends get same 5 commands (session-start/update/note/end + patina-review)
2. Cleanup Claude first (Phase 0): remove persona-start, launch, adapter-manifest
3. `/launch` slash command archived - built Aug 2025, never used
4. `/persona-start` archived - deprecated experiment
5. Git tags should include frontend: `session-{id}-{frontend}-start`

**Challenges Faced:**
- Confusion between `patina launch` (CLI launcher) and `/launch` (slash command for branches) - same name, different things
- Had to trace through git history and sessions to find `/launch` was never actually used
- Spec was 80% obsolete - described work that was already done

**Patterns Observed:**
- "Wheel-spinning" on specs for already-built features is a systemic issue patina should catch
- Testing actual init commands reveals truth faster than reading code
- Gemini and Claude scripts differ only in path substitutions - good for parameterization
- Session files already capture `**LLM**: claude` but git tags don't include frontend
