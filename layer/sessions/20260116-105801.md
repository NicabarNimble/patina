## Previous Session Context
Previous session explored E2 belief creation system design. Key outcome: **reversed MCP decision to Skills-first approach** - skills provide learning value, progressive disclosure, and lower implementation effort. Created working skill prototype in `resources/claude/skills/epistemic-beliefs/` with 3 test beliefs. Discovered deployment gap: skills are in `templates.rs` not `session_scripts.rs`, documented workaround for manual deployment pending fix.

## Goals
- [ ] spec-epistemic-layer

### 13:32 - Update (covering since session start)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 6
- Last commit: 66 seconds ago

**Work Completed:**
1. **Skills deployment in templates.rs** - Added `epistemic-beliefs` skill to embedded templates, now deploys via `adapter refresh`
2. **Preserve custom files on refresh** - Fixed `adapter refresh` to preserve user commands/skills (was deleting them)
3. **Version system analysis** - Discovered manual CLAUDE_ADAPTER_VERSION is tech debt
4. **release-plz fix** - Untracked gitignored files (layer/dust, .trunk, .patina/config.toml) that were causing CI failures
5. **Created spec-version-simplification** - Documents plan to simplify versioning using Cargo.toml as single source of truth

**Key Commits:**
- `be50e070` feat(adapters): add skills deployment to templates.rs
- `abc866a0` fix(adapter): preserve custom commands and skills on refresh
- `036e9c64` chore: untrack gitignored files for release-plz
- `6b31d3e9` docs: add spec-version-simplification

**Key Decisions:**
- Skills follow same pattern as commands (template-managed overwritten, user custom preserved)
- Manual adapter versions are tech debt - use Cargo.toml version managed by release-plz
- Removed .trunk/ entirely (no longer used)
