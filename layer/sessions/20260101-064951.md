**LLM**: claude
**Git Branch**: patina
**Session Tag**: session-20260101-064951-start
**Starting Commit**: 97dd334bbb4a469c6aece08a43ccae2abe67ebd2

## Previous Session Context
Last session completed significant adapter work: (1) archived and removed deprecated `/launch` and `/persona-start` commands using proper git discipline (tag before delete), (2) built complete OpenCode adapter from scratch with 9 template files, (3) added patina-review command to Gemini adapter, and (4) enhanced git tags with frontend identifier (e.g., `session-20251231-155307-claude-start`). Key patterns reinforced: archive-before-delete, code-first spec validation to avoid wheel-spinning on already-built features.

## Goals
- [ ] spec review

## Activity Log
### 06:49 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: spec
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20260101-064951-start


### 07:00 - Update (covering since 06:49)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 11
- Last commit: 14 hours ago

**Work completed:**
- Comprehensive spec review: Read all layer/core values and 15+ specs in layer/surface/build/
- Deep code verification: Audited adapters, commands, module structure against spec claims
- Identified spec-to-code alignment across all major features

**Key findings:**
1. **ACCURATE specs**: llm-frontends, architectural-alignment, pipeline, assay, quality-gates, secrets-v2
2. **OUTDATED spec**: spec-github-adapter claims bounty detection works, but code shows stub (detect_bounty always returns false, removed 2025-12-06). opportunity/ subdirectory doesn't exist.
3. **CONCEPTUAL only**: spec-three-layers describes mother/patina/awaken separation but not enforced in code
4. **FUTURE specs**: build-system, lab-automation, hosts-deploy - documented but not implemented

**Patterns observed:**
- Code-first verification catches documentation drift (spec claims vs actual implementation)
- Specs that get completed get properly archived via git tags
- Specs that describe future work remain accurate about their "not started" status
- Active specs (architectural-alignment) that track living state stay accurate

**Recommendations identified:**
- Update spec-github-adapter.md to mark bounty detection as "Removed/Deferred" not "Complete"
- Remove file structure claims about opportunity/ subdirectory that doesn't exist


### 07:04 - Update (covering since 07:00)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 12
- Last commit: 14 hours ago

**Work completed:**
- Fixed spec-github-adapter.md to reflect reality:
  - Changed status from "Phase 1 Complete" to "Phase 1 Partial"
  - Moved bounty detection from "What Works" to "What's Missing" with 🗑️ status
  - Updated Bounty Detection section to show it was REMOVED (stub code documented)
  - Fixed Files section to show only mod.rs exists (removed opportunity/ claims)
  - Updated validation criteria with strikethrough on bounty detection
  - Removed `--label bounty` from architecture diagram

**Session summary:**
- Comprehensive spec-to-code audit completed
- 6 specs verified accurate, 1 fixed (github-adapter), 1 conceptual (three-layers), 3 future
- Pattern reinforced: code-first verification catches documentation drift
