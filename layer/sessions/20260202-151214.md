## Previous Session Context
Built the full E4.6a multi-hop code grounding pipeline across 11 commits: created `belief_code_reach` table, structural hop (belief→commit→file), `is_source_code()` filtering (100% precision), and lexical fallback for beliefs whose structural hop only reaches docs (recall 43%→86%). Final metrics: 94 source reach files, 100% precision, 86% recall across a 7-belief ground-truth eval set. Key design decision: filter non-source files at the hop, not after, and lexical fallback only fires when structural hop yields no source code.

## Goals
- [x] epistemic value eval

### 15:12-15:45 — 10-Query A/B Eval (evaluation-next.md)

Ran the full eval protocol: 10 task-oriented queries, each with Treatment A
(scry impact: false) and Treatment B (scry impact: true). Scored blind, 0-2.

**Result: baseline 18/20, beliefs 17/20, delta = -0.05 (negative)**

Only 1/8 relevant beliefs surfaced as an annotation (system-owns-format on
parse_belief_file). Treatment B scored worse on query 7 where re-ranking
displaced a useful commit message. Measured complexity costs: 256 KB DB
(0.2%), 4162 lines code (7.7%), negligible scrape overhead.

### 15:45-16:00 — Post-Eval Analysis

Key insight from discussion: the eval only tested the grounding annotation
layer (E4.6a-fix), not the belief system as a whole. The first eval
(evaluation.md, Jan 2026) showed +2.2 delta with knowledge-seeking queries.
These are consistent: belief files as knowledge = high value, grounding
annotations on code = no value.

The real problem is retrieval (last-mile delivery), not system design. The
belief data is correct, structured, and verified — it just doesn't reach the
LLM during task-oriented work. This is an intent→principle matching problem,
not a search problem. Likely a function of mother/orchestration layer.

**Decisions:**
- E4.6b (belief relationships): deprioritized
- E4.6c (forge embeddings): still valid
- E5/E6: deferred — blocked on delivery layer
- E4 steps 8-10 (schema cleanup): still valid
- No more rabbit holes — finish the spec as designed
