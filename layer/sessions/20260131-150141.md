## Previous Session Context
Landed fixes #5 (starting commit after branch switch), #6 (session archive status→archived), and #7 (patterns_modified filter to core|surface|topics only). Cross-adapter testing passed for gemini and opencode full lifecycle, and scraper round-trip verified 548 sessions with zero errors. Key decision made: shift milestones to MINOR versions, reserve PATCH for fixes — specced but not yet implemented.

## Goals
- [x] PATCH for milestones

## Activity Log
### 15:01 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: PATCH for milestones
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20260131-150141-claude-start


### 15:44 - Update (covering since 15:01)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 3
- Files changed: 1
- Last commit: 19 minutes ago

**Work completed:**
- Implemented all 5 deliverables from `refactor/version-semver-alignment` spec
- Added `patina version patch` command (`src/commands/version/internal.rs:bump_patch`, `mod.rs:Patch` variant)
- Updated v1-release SPEC milestone table: 0.9.3-0.9.7 → 0.10.0-0.14.0
- Updated doc comments and CLI help from "Phase.Milestone" to semver terminology
- Added `affects_since` field to spec-system SPEC template for fix specs
- Bumped Cargo.toml 0.9.2 → 0.9.3 using the new patch command (validated it end-to-end)
- Closed both `fix/session-092-hardening` and `refactor/version-semver-alignment` specs

**Key decisions:**
1. `version patch` is simpler than `version milestone` — no spec milestone table to update, just reads Cargo.toml, increments patch, commits, tags
2. `version milestone` code didn't need logic changes — it reads version from spec table, so shifting the table to MINOR versions was sufficient
3. Ran safeguard checks (clean tree, stale index, tag collision) before first patch release — caught stale index, re-scraped, then succeeded

**Patterns observed:**
- The spec-driven version system works well: update the spec table, the tooling follows
- Safeguard checks in version commands caught a real issue (stale index) — worth keeping strict


### 15:50 - Update (covering since 15:44)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 4
- Files changed: 1
- Last commit: 3 minutes ago

**Work completed:**
- Provided design TLDR covering sessions, specs, and versions — how the three systems connect
- Confirmed all 9 fix spec issues resolved (7 fixed, 2 deferred by design)
- Captured belief: `spec-drives-tooling` — "change the data, not the code" with supports link to `spec-is-contract`

**Session summary:**
All goals complete. Semver alignment fully implemented and validated. v0.9.3 released. Next milestone is v0.10.0 (Epistemic E4).
