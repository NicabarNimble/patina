## Previous Session Context
Last session recovered from a crash and captured 6 major decisions for the skills-focused adapter refactoring (enum-implements-trait, namespace-based ownership, marker sections for bootstrap, no migration code, remove versioning). Discovered a critical bug: `patina repo add` uses only repo name as identifier causing collisions (e.g., `anthropics/skills` and `huggingface/skills` both map to "skills"). Created `layer/surface/build/spec-repo-org-namespace.md` with migration strategy that preserves expensive oxidize data by renaming directories and updating registry paths.

## Goals
- [ ] repo-org-namespace

## Activity Log
### 11:57 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: repo-org-namespace
Working on branch: patina

### 14:35 - Update (covering since 11:57)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 9
- Last commit: 2 days ago

**Work Completed:**
- Deep dive into repo-org-namespace spec and code (`internal.rs`, `mod.rs`)
- Rewrote `spec-repo-org-namespace.md` with cleaner approach:
  - No migration code in Rust (was adding permanent code for one-time operation)
  - Manual migration steps (bash commands for human)
  - Clear phases with CHECKPOINTs
  - Always require full `org/repo` (no short-name convenience)
- Created `spec-spec-as-skill.md` - meta-spec for uniform spec design

**Key Decisions:**
1. **No migration code** - User pointed out adding permanent Rust code for one-time migration was wrong approach. Manual migration via bash + YAML edit is cleaner.
2. **Always full org/repo** - No short-name convenience. Simplifies code, clear expectations.
3. **Specs as evolvable system** - Format lives in template doc, skill reads template. Update template → skill adapts. No code changes to evolve spec format.

**Discussion Context:**
- User confused when I jumped into coding without explicit go-ahead - reverted changes
- Clarified that specs are guides for LLM with human checkpoints, not places for permanent migration code
- Explored how skills could help with spec consistency → led to spec-spec-as-skill

**Patterns Observed:**
- Spec purpose: guide LLM through phased work with human checkpoints
- Migration code smell: if it runs once then does nothing, it shouldn't be permanent
- Template-driven skills: skill reads format from doc, adapts when doc changes


### 14:35 - Session End

No additional work since last update. Session ending with spec design complete, no code changes committed.

**Session Summary:**
- Rewrote `spec-repo-org-namespace.md` (cleaner: no migration code, manual migration)
- Created `spec-spec-as-skill.md` (meta-spec for uniform spec design)
- No implementation started - pure spec/design work
