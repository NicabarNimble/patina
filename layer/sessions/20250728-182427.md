## Previous Session Context
This is the inaugural run of Patina's new hook-based session system. No previous session exists as we're bootstrapping the session workflow for the first time.

## Goals
- [ ] Test the new session commands (/session-start, /session-update, /session-end)
- [ ] Verify the session workflow captures both git changes and conversation context
- [ ] Ensure session files are created in the correct locations
- [ ] Validate the integration between Claude adapter and session scripts
- [ ] Document any issues or improvements needed for the session system

## Activity Log
### 18:24 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: this is the first run of the new session commands

### 18:25 - Initial Discoveries
- Confirmed session commands are in `.claude/bin/` for dogfooding (not `resources/`)
- Session was created successfully with ID: 20250728-182427
- Active session file created at `.claude/context/active-session.md`
- Branch tracking working: feature/hook-based-sessions
- Git status awareness: 20 uncommitted files detected

### 18:26 - First Run Observations
- No previous session exists (expected for first run)
- Session system properly created placeholder for "Previous Session Context"
- Goals section ready for AI enhancement
- The system asked for todo creation (good integration with TodoWrite tool)


### 18:30 - Update (covering since 18:24)
First test of session-update - verifying time span marking and context capture

**Work completed during this period:**
- Started the inaugural Patina session using `/session-start`
- Discovered initial path issue (looking in `resources/` instead of `.claude/bin/`)
- Verified correct session command locations:
  - Scripts in `.claude/bin/` (session-start.sh, session-update.sh, etc.)
  - Commands in `.claude/commands/` (session-start.md, session-update.md, etc.)
- Successfully created session ID: 20250728-182427
- Enhanced session file with proper goals for testing session workflow
- Created TodoWrite tasks for systematic testing of all session commands
- Began testing `/session-update` command functionality

**Key observations:**
- Session system properly handles first-run edge case (no previous session)
- Git integration working (detected feature/hook-based-sessions branch)
- Time span tracking creates clear markers for context capture
- Integration with content-capture agent for filling in activity


### 18:32 - Note
not sure why we track git changes yet need to figure out what is happening there

### 18:33 - Session End (covering since 18:30)
