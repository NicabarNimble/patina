## Previous Session Context
The previous session focused on learning new git commands and exploring git integration capabilities. Session was completed with git commands review and integration planning documented.

## Goals
- [ ] Connect Patina's existing git functions to the new git memory system
- [ ] Integrate git hooks with Patina's pattern tracking
- [ ] Ensure seamless workflow between git operations and pattern evolution

## Activity Log
### 13:58 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: connecting patina existing git functions


### 12:51 - Update (covering since 13:58)

**Work completed:**
- Deep dive into Patina's existing git state machine implementation
- Reviewed all git-related documentation in layer/
- Reorganized docs: moved theory/philosophy to dust, kept source-of-truth in surface
- Simplified session-git-* command flow docs for immediate implementation
- Removed complex GitEvent/state machine integration references
- Created clear, implementable bash-based git integration approach

**Key decisions and reasoning:**
- Decision: Simplify git integration to basic branch + commit operations first
- Reasoning: Complex state machine exists but has no input mechanism, better to start simple
- Decision: Keep session branches forever as memory containers
- Reasoning: Git history becomes searchable LLM memory across conversations
- Decision: Focus on git-as-memory, defer pattern extraction
- Reasoning: Get working implementation first, enhance later

**Challenges faced and solutions:**
- Challenge: Git state machine (Rust) can't receive events from bash scripts
- Solution: Skip state machine integration for now, use pure bash approach
- Challenge: Overcomplicated documentation with too many ideas
- Solution: Moved theory to dust/, kept only implementable docs in surface
- Challenge: Session commands work well, can't break them
- Solution: Create parallel session-git-* commands for testing

**Patterns observed:**
- Over-engineering before validation (state machine built for future that didn't arrive)
- Documentation sprawl (many overlapping git strategy docs)
- The session-as-branch concept is the key innovation
- Git as memory system (not just version control) solves LLM persistence
