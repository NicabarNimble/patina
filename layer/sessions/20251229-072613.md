## Previous Session Context
Last session fixed a release-plz collision issue where the crate name "patina" conflicted with an existing UEFI SDK on crates.io (v19.0.0). Solution: renamed `[package] name` to "patina-ai" while keeping binary and library names as "patina". Commit 4d39c6ea was pushed to origin/patina branch. Session prepared PR content but didn't create the PR itself - that's the task for this session.

## Goals
- [ ] Create PR to merge patina branch into main with release-plz cargo name fix
