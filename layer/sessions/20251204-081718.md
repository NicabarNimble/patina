## Previous Session Context
Previous session committed the Mothership daemon work with 5 surgical commits following "scalpel not shotgun" discipline. Major accomplishments: `patina serve` subcommand with rouille HTTP server, `/health` and `/version` endpoints, Phase 3f spec documentation, and README refresh. PR #48 was created and merged to main, completing Phase 3 Hackathon MVP. All 136 tests pass with clean fmt/clippy.

## Goals
- [x] Review codebase for dead code
- [x] Identify abandoned/unused files
- [x] Clean up any orphaned implementations
- [x] Code review for hackathon MVP readiness
- [x] Update build.md roadmap with findings

## Activity Log
### 08:17 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: dead code / abandoned files review
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20251204-081718-start

### 08:17-09:00 - Repository Cleanup for Public Release

**Completed:**
1. **Personal Info Removal** - Sanitized `/Users/nicabar` paths in spec docs, added ENVIRONMENT.toml to .gitignore
2. **Dead Code Removal** - Deleted 5 debug scripts (debug_ast.rs, test_*.rs, test_*.sh)
3. **Test Directory Cleanup** - Removed test-workspace/, test_behavioral_hints/, workspace/
4. **Dependency Cleanup** - Removed unused `automerge`, fixed tree-sitter comment (actually used)
5. **Git Cleanup** - Deleted 10 abandoned branches, pruned orphaned worktrees

**Commit:** `a14a92ea` - chore: cleanup for public release (-1,353 lines)
**PR #49:** Created and merged to main

### 09:00-15:52 - Code Review (Andrew Ng Persona)

**Key Findings:**
- Architecture solid (8.6x measured improvement for semantic search)
- **Critical Gap:** Bounty data goes INTO database but doesn't come OUT
- `is_bounty`, `bounty_amount` stored in `github_issues` but not exposed in `ScryResult`
- `--label` flag documented but not implemented
- `update_repo` doesn't re-scrape GitHub issues

**Two Tracks to 10x Productivity:**
- Track A (P0): Bounty workflow - expose bounty data (2 days)
- Track B (P1): Mothership daemon phases 2-4 (3-4 days)

**Updated:** layer/core/build.md with Phase 3g (Bounty Workflow Completion)

### 15:52 - Update (covering since 08:17)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 1 (cleanup)
- PR merged: #49
- Files cleaned: 36 files, -1,353 lines
- build.md updated with code review findings (uncommitted)
