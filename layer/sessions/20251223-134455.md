## Previous Session Context
Performed an Andrew Ng-style audit of build.md vs implementation reality. Found and fixed a critical doc_id format mismatch bug that was preventing RRF fusion from properly merging results across oracles. Ran ablation testing that revealed semantic oracle (MRR 0.201) is the bottleneck while lexical does heavy lifting (MRR 0.422). Documented 4 gaps in Observable Scry and created a lab automation spec for faster iteration.

## Goals
- [x] Doc clean up and build.md reset

### 14:33 - Update (covering since 13:44)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 3
- Files changed: 4 (build.md, spec-assay.md, spec-work-deferred.md)
- Last commit: 18 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
- Archived Observable Scry spec (Phase 1-3 complete) with git tag `spec/observable-scry`
- Reset build.md: wired up `spec-persona-fusion` and `spec-secrets-boundary` as new active specs
- Moved `spec-lab-automation` to Future (draft, not built)
- Deferred Assay Phase 1 (snapshot subcommand) to spec-work-deferred.md
- Generated comprehensive TLDR of all Patina capabilities

**Discussion Context:**
- Deep dive into what Patina actually does vs what README claims
- Verified sessions ARE scraped → embedded → queryable (I was initially wrong about this)
- Traced code: `scrape sessions` → eventlog → `oxidize` → semantic index → `scry` returns session content
- Live tested: `patina scry "error handling"` returns session decisions/goals mixed with code

**Key Decisions:**
- Leave spec-assay.md alone for user's planned deep dive
- Assay Phase 0 (core queries) is complete; Phase 1 (snapshot) is edge case, deferred
- Persona-fusion addresses visibility gap, not functionality gap

**Patterns Observed:**
- README's core promise IS TRUE: sessions → observations → embeddings → retrieval works
- The gap is VISIBILITY (no `[SESSION]` vs `[CODE]` tags), not broken functionality
- spec-persona-fusion directly addresses this visibility gap
- Deferred work (feedback loop, capture automation) would make it SMARTER, but core value prop is delivered


### 14:33 - Final Update

**Work Completed:**
- Confirmed README vision alignment: Patina IS delivering on its core promise
- Validated current build.md direction marches forward on the vision

**Key Insight:**
The README claims "session insights → observations → embeddings → retrieval" - this is TRUE and working. The active specs (persona-fusion, secrets-boundary) polish and extend, they don't fix broken fundamentals.
