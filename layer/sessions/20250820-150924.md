**LLM**: claude
**Git Branch**: experiment/clean-memory-tools

## Previous Session Context
The last session "fix issues with Git metrics system" was an exploration session on the experiment/pattern-recognition branch. The session involved significant investigation work with 18 files changed and 7 patterns modified, though no commits were made during the session period. The work focused on deep testing of the Git metrics system, likely identifying issues and exploring potential solutions. The session was properly tagged (session-20250820-092339-start to session-20250820-092339-end) and classified as exploration, indicating research and discovery work rather than direct implementation.

## Goals
- [ ] more git activity

## Activity Log
### 15:09 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: more git activity
Working on branch: experiment/clean-memory-tools
Tagged as: session-20250820-150924-start


### 16:56 - Update (covering since 15:09)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 8
- Last commit: 10 hours ago

**Work completed**:
- Conducted comprehensive Git audit of repository patterns
- Created `layer/surface/git-audit-findings.md` documenting good/bad Git practices
- Reviewed session-git-* command system architecture 
- Created `layer/surface/session-git-commands-review.md` analyzing LLM guardrails
- Updated CLAUDE.md with Git Discipline section using "scalpel not shotgun" principle
- Cleaned up Recent Developments section while preserving key architecture details

**Key decisions**:
- Adopted "Commit often, use scalpel not shotgun" as core Git principle
- Avoided overly prescriptive rules (no "NEVER" statements) to maintain flexibility
- Preserved all architecture documentation (Modular Workspace, Pattern Selection)
- Added Session-Git Commands section to document recent developments

**Challenges faced**:
- Balance between enforcing good habits vs maintaining flexibility
- Initial tendency to remove important architecture documentation when cleaning
- Finding right level of Git commit enforcement without being too restrictive

**Patterns observed**:
- Script-generated consistency prevents LLM naming/path mistakes
- Dual MD/SH design effectively keeps LLMs on rails
- Best commits have single verb, single target, clear purpose
- "Comprehensive" or "and" in commit messages indicate shotgun commits
- Session tagging system creates permanent Git memory of work context


### 17:08 - Update (covering since 16:56)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        4
- Files changed: 4
- Last commit: 4 minutes ago

**Work completed**:
- Applied scalpel approach to commit backlog
- Made 4 focused commits separating different concerns
- Each commit had single purpose: Git Discipline, audit findings, session review, session archive

**Key decisions**:
- Committed each document separately rather than bundling
- Discovered memory module files were already staged (from earlier work)
- Left navigation.db changes uncommitted (as per audit recommendation)

**Patterns observed**:
- Scalpel approach worked well - 4 clear commits vs 1 giant one
- Git included previously staged files automatically (memory module)
- Binary database files continue to create Git noise


## Session Classification
