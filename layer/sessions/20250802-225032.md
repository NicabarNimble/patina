## Previous Session Context
The last session successfully implemented hooks auto-installation in Patina's Claude adapter. Fixed hooks configuration by moving from hooks.json to settings.local.json, created resources/claude/hooks/ directory with all hook scripts, and updated the adapter to automatically install hooks during `patina init`. Key insight: hooks enable non-intrusive git awareness in Claude Code.

## Goals
- [ ] hooks test and more branch trim
