**LLM**: claude
**Git Branch**: patina
**Session Tag**: session-20260108-200725-start

## Previous Session Context
Deep design exploration of the `layer/surface/` role in patina architecture. Created `spec-surface-layer.md` with grounded requirements after exploring context compression research and grounding fancy "typed graph" designs back to reality. Key decisions: surface is the federation interface (other projects query surface, not eventlog/embeddings), follows Obsidian model (atomic files + wikilinks), derived from eventlog but committed to git for portability. Open item: implement surface generation.

## Goals
- [ ] Surface layer design and implementation

### 22:52 - Update (covering since 20:07)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 0
- Files changed: 4
- Last commit: 10 hours ago

**Work Completed:**
- Deep design discussion clarifying surface layer's position in the stack
- Rewrote `spec-surface-layer.md` with refined understanding
- Established surface as the distillation layer ABOVE scry/assay/oxidize
- Defined three raw file types: sessions (talking), git (doing), surface (understanding)

**Discussion Context:**
- Started with reviewing git history and recent sessions
- Walked through mental model diagrams (git vs non-git, the stack)
- User pushed back on "we don't need surface" framing
- Grounded discussion in: "we built extraction for code/git, now need same for knowledge"
- LLM-as-driver framing: surface exists to make LLMs smarter via MCP tools

**Key Decisions:**
1. **Surface is distillation, not input**: It's the next level UP, not parallel to eventlog
2. **Flat structure**: No subdirectories, let links carry structure
3. **Generated, not authored**: `patina surface` queries scry/assay to populate
4. **The cycle**: Git → eventlog → tools → SURFACE → Git
5. **Surface vs Persona**: Surface is project-level, persona is user-level (mothership)

**Challenges Faced:**
- Initial framing put surface as parallel system (like sessions)
- User kept pushing toward "what is surface actually FOR"
- Breakthrough: "we built system around git/code, now need same for knowledge"

**Patterns Observed:**
1. **Ground design in existing architecture** - Surface builds on scry/assay, doesn't replace
2. **User knows the shape** - Keep asking "what's your intuition" to find the real insight
3. **Three raw file types** - Clean mental model: talking, doing, understanding
