## Previous Session Context
Last session (keyring) completed Phase 1 of forge abstraction: implemented conventional commit parsing in `src/commands/scrape/git/commits.rs` with 10 unit tests, validated on real repos (patina: 98% conventional, dojo: 61% conventional with 49% PR refs). Key discovery: Claude Code logs ALL prompts to `~/.claude/history.jsonl` with sessionId and timestamp - created `spec-session-prompts.md` to capture this for Phase 2 implementation. Made 9 surgical commits following "scalpel not shotgun" discipline.

## Goals
- [ ] Implement Phase 2: ForgeReader trait (CORRECTED - was mistakenly set to session-prompts)

### 10:11 - Update (covering since 09:49)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 0
- Files changed: 1
- Last commit: 30 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
- Gathered context: read layer/core values (unix-philosophy, dependable-rust), build.md, spec-session-prompts.md
- Discovered session goal mismatch: "session-prompts pahse 2" was interpreted as session-prompts spec, but should have been Phase 2 ForgeReader
- Read spec-forge-abstraction.md to prepare for correct work
- Investigated Claude Code UI change: rejection flow now requires new prompt instead of inline redirect

**Key Observations:**
- build.md clearly shows "Phase 2 Next: Create src/forge/ module with ForgeReader trait"
- spec-session-prompts.md status is "Design" (not implementation priority)
- Claude Code changelog (v2.0.57) added "feedback input when rejecting plans" but general tool rejection flow change appears undocumented

**Session Classification:**
- Exploration session - no code changes, context gathering only
- Course correction: identified wrong goal, will restart with correct focus
