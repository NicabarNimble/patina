## Previous Session Context
Completed comprehensive Python language extraction implementation with ConstantFact and MemberFact support, successfully extracting 85 constants (including module-level UPPER_CASE constants and inheritance relationships), 165 class members (methods and constructors with visibility), and 205 functions with full type hint preservation. The implementation followed the established C++/Go/Rust patterns and was tested against the cortex repository, achieving the goal of providing LLMs with complete knowledge for generating idiomatic Python code.

## Goals
- [ ] Language Extraction Python Review Docs Update

## Activity Log
### 05:57 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: Language Extraction Python Review Docs Update
Working on branch: work
Tagged as: session-20250911-055752-start


### 06:41 - Update (covering since 05:57)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 6
- Last commit: 18 hours ago

**Work completed:**
- Reviewed git history and layer/sessions to understand Python extraction implementation from previous session
- Built and installed patina in release mode with cargo (resolved minor warnings about unused variables)
- Verified Python extraction functionality by running `patina scrape code --force --repo cortex`
- Validated extraction results directly in DuckDB: confirmed 85 constants, 165 members, 205 functions
- Updated language-extraction-analysis.md to mark Python as Implementation Complete ✅
- Added Cortex repository to the analyzed repositories list with extraction metrics

**Key decisions:**
- Verified extraction results using direct DuckDB queries before updating documentation
- Followed the same documentation pattern as C, C++, Go, and Rust for consistency
- Marked Python as fully complete based on successful extraction of all planned features
- Preserved detailed feature list showing what's extracted (type hints, inheritance, visibility)

**Challenges faced:**
- Initial build showed unused variable warnings in Go and Python extractors (parent_index, const_type, field_type)
- These are minor issues that don't affect functionality - variables assigned but not used

**Patterns observed:**
- The ConstantFact/MemberFact pattern successfully generalizes across all major languages
- Python's underscore naming conventions map cleanly to visibility modifiers
- UPPER_CASE convention for constants works well for Python module-level detection
- Direct database validation is essential before marking features as complete


### 06:44 - Update (covering since 06:41)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        2
- Files changed: 0
- Last commit: 66 seconds ago

**Work completed:**
- Committed Python extraction implementation with comprehensive commit message
- Committed accumulated session notes from previous language extraction work
- Cleaned up working tree - all changes now committed

**Key decisions:**
- Created two separate commits: one for Python implementation, one for session notes
- Used detailed commit message documenting validation metrics and features

**Patterns observed:**
- The language extraction work across C, C++, Go, Rust, and Python follows a consistent evolution pattern
- Session notes provide valuable context for understanding implementation decisions
