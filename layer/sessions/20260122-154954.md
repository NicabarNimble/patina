## Previous Session Context
Last session "Spec reorg review and state of union on patina" (pattern-work, 8 commits, 22 files): Fixed commit enrichment bug in `src/commands/scry/internal/enrichment.rs` where commits at offset 3B weren't being found. Added MCP auto-configuration to launcher in `src/adapters/launch.rs`. Moved bench querysets from `/eval/` to `resources/bench/` after clarifying that `layer/` is project-specific knowledge while `resources/` is patina's own development artifacts. Discovered skill enforcement issue - LLM bypassed belief creation skill using raw heredoc, created spec `layer/surface/build/refactor/skill-enforcement/SPEC.md` to address skills being guidance instead of rails. Captured belief: `layer-is-project-knowledge`.

## Goals
- [ ] Specs review and next items to do

## Activity Log
### 15:49 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: Specs review and next items to do
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20260122-154954-claude-start


### 21:33 - Update (covering since 15:49)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 5
- Files changed: ~50
- Last commit: 2 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
- Completed "mother-naming" refactor: renamed all "mothership" references to "mother" across codebase
- Updated 16 Rust source files: functions, struct fields, env vars, doc comments
- Fixed critical bug in `patina-dogfood-v1.json` - paths referenced non-existent `src/mothership/`
- Renamed `spec-mothership.md` → `spec-mother.md`
- Updated 25 layer/ documentation files (concepts, specs, epistemic beliefs)
- Added env var migration: `PATINA_MOTHER` with deprecation warning for `PATINA_MOTHERSHIP`

**Key Decisions:**
- Keep references to git tag `spec/mothership-graph` as-is (git tags are immutable)
- Keep legacy env var support with warning for smooth migration
- Use "Mother" (capitalized) for user-facing output, "mother" (lowercase) in code/comments
- Session files in `layer/sessions/` left untouched (historical records)

**Challenges Faced:**
- Context crashed mid-session, recovered from cached state table
- Many files to update - used sed for bulk changes, manual edits for surgical precision
- Spec-mothership-graph.md was archived to git tag, needed to update broken file links

**Git Discipline:**
- Created 5 surgical commits instead of one shotgun commit:
  1. `refactor(mother): rename mothership to mother in source code`
  2. `refactor(bench): update mothership refs in benchmark files`
  3. `refactor(spec): rename spec-mothership.md to spec-mother.md`
  4. `docs: update mothership to mother in layer/ documentation`
  5. `spec: add mother-naming refactor spec`


### 21:53 - Update (covering since 21:33)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 0
- Files changed: 2
- Last commit: 21 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
- Session update documenting mother-naming refactor
- Reviewed active specs status in build.md
- Identified `spec-database-identity.md` status update as separate uncommitted work

**Session Summary:**
- Goal was "specs review" but pivoted to completing mother-naming refactor
- Original spec review interrupted when naming inconsistency discovered
- Left off reviewing: spec-mother Phase 1, spec-database-identity Phase 2-3, spec-epistemic-layer E3
