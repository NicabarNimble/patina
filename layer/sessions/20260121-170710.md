## Previous Session Context
Session "spec" completed database-identity Phase 1 - simplified the UID model to random 32-bit IDs with git propagation, implemented auto-create migration across `scaffold_patina()`, `update_repo()`, and scrape entry points so existing projects/repos get UIDs automatically. Added UID display to `patina doctor`, verified all 16 ref repos migrated successfully, and captured the "self-healing-invariants" belief (prefer auto-create over fail-fast guards). Six commits made.

## Goals
- [ ] Review active specs and determine next actions
- [ ] spec review

## Activity Log
### 17:07 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: active
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20260121-170710-claude-start

### 17:15 - Active Specs Review
Deep review of all 7 active specs against codebase:
1. belief-validation-system - NEW spec, not yet implemented
2. skills-focused-adapter - Design complete, needs implementation
3. database-identity - Phase 1 COMPLETE (last session)
4. surface-layer - Not implemented, no `patina surface` command
5. report - Phase 1 IMPLEMENTED and working
6. mothership - Graph (Phase 2) complete, Phase 1 federated query pending (no longer blocked!)
7. three-layers - Workshop/reference spec, no implementation planned yet

### 17:45 - Command Deep Analysis
Analyzed all 22 CLI commands for waste/tech debt:
- Core pipeline (scrape, oxidize, scry, assay, rebuild): ESSENTIAL
- Infrastructure (serve, repo, model, mother, persona, adapter): ESSENTIAL
- Quality (eval, bench, report, doctor): VALUABLE
- Lifecycle (init, upgrade, version): NECESSARY
- **Waste identified:** build (32 lines), test (31 lines) - trivial wrappers
- **Out of scope:** yolo (1,613 lines) - devcontainer generation
- **Tangential:** secrets (2,089 lines) - over-engineered but useful

### 17:50 - New Specs Created
1. spec-remove-build-test.md - Ready to implement, remove 63 lines of dead code
2. spec-explore-agents.md - Exploration spec for yolo/codex agent concepts

### 18:00 - Session End
**Summary:** Deep review of all 9 active specs against codebase. Analyzed 22 CLI commands for waste/tech debt. Created 2 new specs. Updated build.md and spec-mothership.md to reflect vocabulary-gap completion.

**Key findings:**
- vocabulary-gap spec is COMPLETE (was marked as blocking mothership)
- database-identity Phase 1 done, Phases 2-3 remain
- build/test commands are dead code (63 lines to remove)
- yolo is out of scope (1,613 lines, needs decision)

**Files modified:**
- layer/core/build.md - Added new specs, updated statuses
- layer/surface/build/spec-mothership.md - Removed stale blocker
- layer/surface/build/spec-remove-build-test.md - NEW
- layer/surface/build/spec-explore-agents.md - NEW
