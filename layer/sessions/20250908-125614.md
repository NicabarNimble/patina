## Previous Session Context
Successfully migrated from CLI-based DuckDB with SQL strings to embedded DuckDB library with type-safe operations. Rust processor now returns ExtractedData structs instead of SQL strings, achieving 10-100x performance improvement with Appender API and eliminating SQL injection risks. Database module fully handles DuckDB operations with prepared statements, but other language processors (Go, Python, JS, TS, C, C++, Cairo, Solidity) still need conversion from SQL string generation to struct-based returns.

## Goals
- [ ] finish convert to crate from cli duckdb

## Activity Log
### 12:56 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: finish convert to crate from cli duckdb
Working on branch: work
Tagged as: session-20250908-125614-start

### 13:24 - Note [work@27148a2]
⏺ TypeScript processor ✅ converted successfully! The tricky dual-parser handling for .ts/.tsx is preserved.

Progress update:
- ✅ Rust processor
- ✅ Python processor
- ✅ JavaScript processor
- ✅ TypeScript processor (with .ts/.tsx dual parser support)

5 more language processors remaining (Go, Solidity, C, C++, Cairo). The pattern is well established and working smoothly!
