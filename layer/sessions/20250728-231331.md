**LLM**: claude

## Previous Session Context
The last session focused on understanding and fixing the git context integration in session files. Key accomplishments included removing git-related code from session-start.sh that was causing incorrect assumptions about session goals, and discovering that the .claude directory is shared between Claude Code and Patina with both tools coexisting harmoniously through the slash command system.

## Goals
- [ ] session docs clean up

## Activity Log
### 23:13 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: session docs clean up


### 23:26 - Update (covering since 23:13)

**Work completed**:
- Reviewed all layer docs containing session-related documentation
- Identified 4 outdated/deprecated session design documents
- Added DEPRECATED notices to: session-redesign.md, hook-session-architecture.md, session-automation-solution.md, smart-session-naming.md
- Discovered that `/session-note` command actually IS implemented (was incorrectly documented as not implemented)
- Updated session-implementation.md to correct the `/session-note` documentation
- Created new current-session-workflow.md with accurate, comprehensive documentation of how sessions work

**Key decisions and reasoning**:
- Chose to add DEPRECATED notices rather than delete files to preserve design history
- Each deprecated notice explains what was wrong and points to correct documentation
- Created separate current-session-workflow.md to provide clear reference without the implementation details

**Challenges faced and solutions**:
- Initial confusion about which features were actually implemented vs just designed
- Solved by checking actual shell scripts and command files to verify implementation
- Found discrepancy between documentation claiming session-note wasn't implemented when it actually was

**Patterns observed**:
- Many elaborate designs (hooks, automation, smart naming) were explored but ultimately rejected for simpler solutions
- Current implementation follows "do one thing well" philosophy - just simple slash commands
- Documentation drift is common when implementations evolve but docs aren't updated
