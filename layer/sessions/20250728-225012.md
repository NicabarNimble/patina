## Activity Log
### 22:50 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: session


### 22:59 - Update (covering since 22:50)

**Work completed**: 
- Identified issue with session-start.sh including git context (branch name) in session files
- This was causing incorrect assumptions about session goals based on branch names
- Removed all git-related code from session-start.sh to keep sessions focused on intent
- Synchronized resources/claude/session-start.sh with .claude/bin/session-start.sh

**Key decisions**:
- Decided to completely remove git context from session-start for now
- Git information was leading to confusion rather than providing value
- Sessions should focus on user intent, not environmental context
- Git integration can be reconsidered later with clearer use cases

**Challenges faced**:
- Initial session file incorrectly assumed work on "hook-based sessions" due to branch name
- Had to balance useful context (git state) with potential for misinterpretation

**Patterns observed**:
- Environmental context in templates can lead AI to make incorrect assumptions
- Keeping session files minimal and focused on intent improves clarity
- Synchronization between resources/ and working directories is critical

### 23:11 - Update (covering since 22:59)

**Work completed**:
- Reviewed entire .claude directory structure to understand ownership
- Discovered .claude is shared between Claude Code and Patina
- Verified all session-related files (commands/*.md and bin/*.sh) are in sync
- Corrected misunderstanding about directory ownership (Claude Code vs Claude Desktop)

**Key decisions**:
- .claude directory is intentionally shared between Claude Code and Patina
- Patina cleverly extends Claude Code by adding session commands to existing slash command system
- No cleanup needed - both tools coexist without conflict

**Challenges faced**:
- Initially misidentified Claude Code files as Claude Desktop
- Had to research Claude Code documentation to understand directory structure

**Patterns observed**:
- Patina integrates with Claude Code rather than replacing it
- Using existing infrastructure (slash commands) is better than creating parallel systems
- Clear separation of concerns: Claude Code provides base, Patina adds session management
