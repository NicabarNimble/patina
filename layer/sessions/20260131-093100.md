## Previous Session Context
Completed 0.9.2 Phase 3: deleted 12 legacy shell scripts (1,846 lines removed) from `resources/{claude,gemini,opencode}/`, confirmed embedded `include_str!` references and `navigation.db` writes were already clean, and bumped version to 0.9.2 via `patina version milestone`. All 10 exit criteria in SPEC.md checked off — the session system is now fully on Rust-based commands with shell wrappers only for backward compatibility.
