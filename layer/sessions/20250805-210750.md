# Session: merge
**ID**: 20250805-210750

## Previous Session Context
The previous session focused on developing a unified context system for Patina. This work explored consolidating the various context management components into a cohesive architecture. Key accomplishments included documenting the unified context approach and identifying integration points between the brain patterns, session management, and environment detection systems.

## Goals
- [ ] merge

## Activity Log
### 21:07 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: merge


### 22:47 - Update (covering since 21:07)

**Work completed:**
- Reviewed unified context system discussions and architectural decisions
- Analyzed comparison between unified context system vs incremental enhancements
- Examined recent sessions documenting SQLite/Automerge refactor work
- Discovered uncommitted changes from the refactor (SQLite + Automerge CRDT implementation)
- Committed all changes with comprehensive commit message
- Successfully pushed feat/navigation-state-system-sqlite branch to GitHub

**Key decisions:**
- Acknowledged that incremental approach aligns better with Patina's Unix philosophy
- Recognized the tension between powerful AI awareness and system simplicity
- Decided to commit and push all SQLite/Automerge refactor work before any merge
- Maintained escape hatch philosophy by archiving SQLite design doc to dust/

**Challenges faced:**
- Initial confusion about merge readiness due to uncommitted changes
- Understanding the architectural evolution from rqlite → SQLite → Hybrid approach
- Balancing the appeal of unified context system with core simplicity principles

**Patterns observed:**
- Documentation evolution mirrors code evolution (separate experimental docs → merged design)
- Incremental enhancements provide more value than grand architectures
- Unix philosophy serves as effective guard rail against feature creep
- The "capture raw, distill later" approach prevents premature abstraction
