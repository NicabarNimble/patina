### 08:51 - Update (covering since 05:52)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 3
- Last commit: 12 hours ago

**Work Completed:**
- Reviewed last 3 days of git history showing successful refactoring of stable-parsing-engine
- Analyzed DESIGN.md documenting the engine's current state and future roadmap
- Designed new `ask`/`answer` architecture replacing the `context` command concept
- Defined session storage schema for DuckDB to capture development knowledge

**Key Decisions:**
- **Rename context → ask**: More intuitive UX where users "ask" questions and get "answers" not just context
- **Sessions as first-class knowledge**: Sessions contain critical "why" information missing from code extraction
- **Multi-source answer assembly**: Combine code facts (40%), sessions (30%), patterns (20%), call graph (10%)
- **Progressive enhancement strategy**: Start with keyword matching, add intelligence incrementally

**Architecture Insights:**
- The ask/answer paradigm aligns perfectly with Patina's accumulation philosophy
- Session knowledge fills the "why" gap that code extraction can't provide
- Answer assembly > context dumping: Build coherent, ranked responses
- Sessions should be parsed and indexed like code, not just stored as logs

**Next Steps Identified:**
- Implement session storage tables in DuckDB
- Build session parser to extract structured knowledge from markdown
- Create the ask command with question analysis and evidence collection
