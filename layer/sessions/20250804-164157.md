## Previous Session Context
Successfully implemented git-aware navigation with SQLite persistence, removing all async code that was introduced for rqlite. The migration included adding CR-SQLite support as a runtime extension (CRDT-ready when available) and implementing parallel file indexing with Rayon. All three implementation phases were completed, trading network distribution for simpler embedded storage aligned with Patina's philosophy.
