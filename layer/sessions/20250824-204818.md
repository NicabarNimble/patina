## Previous Session Context
Continued work on the stable parsing engine design, focusing on blob SHA-based incremental parsing. The session explored implementation approaches for tracking and incrementally parsing files based on content changes rather than timestamps.

## Goals
- [ ] stable-parsing-engine

## Activity Log
### 20:48 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: stable-parsing-engine

### 21:27 - Update (covering since 20:48)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 7
- Last commit: 12 hours ago

**Work completed:**
- Reviewed stable-parsing-engine documentation (DESIGN.md and TODO.md)
- Explored DuckDB capabilities using scraped repository data
- Analyzed DuckDB repo with advanced SQL queries (window functions, CTEs, aggregations)
- Discovered Cortex memory system architecture but decided Patina's approach is superior
- Designed unified memory system concept: sessions + code facts + patterns all in DuckDB

**Key decisions:**
- Keep mtime-based tracking (not switching to blob SHA) - simplicity wins
- Add doc_text columns to existing tables rather than separate doc table
- Evolve toward unified DuckDB memory system instead of scattered markdown files
- Rust + DuckDB > Python + vector DBs for code intelligence

**Insights:**
- DuckDB's analytical capabilities are perfect for code intelligence queries
- Session markdown files could be parsed and loaded into DuckDB for queryable history
- Everything becomes facts with relationships, not disconnected files with stale metadata
- The "just facts in a database" philosophy extends beyond code to entire development memory
