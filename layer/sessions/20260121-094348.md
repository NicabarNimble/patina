## Previous Session Context
Session "prolog" completed the 4-phase removal of ~2,660 lines of dead neuro-symbolic code (src/reasoning/, src/storage/, src/query/, semantic_search_demo.rs) with strong Git archive via tag `archive/prolog-exploration-2025-11`. All 22 CLI commands verified working, index rebuilt via `scrape --rebuild` and `oxidize`. Spec marked complete and archived.

## Goals
- [x] tldr and review of active specs from build doc

## Activity Log
### 09:43 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: tldr and review of active specs from build doc
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20260121-094348-claude-start

### 10:24 - Session Complete

**Work Completed:**
- Reviewed all 10 active specs from build.md with TLDR summaries
- Implemented vocabulary-gap Phase 1: `expanded_terms` MCP parameter for LLM query expansion
- Implemented session-prompts: capture user prompts from ~/.claude/history.jsonl
- Updated all adapter templates (claude, gemini, opencode) with Start Timestamp
- Fixed opencode LLM_NAME bug (was "claude", now "opencode")
- Discovered spec-repo-org-namespace was already implemented (commit 9724480e)
- Properly archived 3 specs with git tags

**Key Decisions:**
- vocabulary-gap is non-deterministic (LLM hint, not guaranteed)
- session-prompts only works for Claude (history.jsonl is Claude-specific)
- Archived specs stay in surface/build/ but get tags and moved to Archived section in build.md

**Commits:**
1. `1df7ecce` feat: add vocabulary gap bridging and session prompt capture
2. `15ca5fb5` docs: mark specs complete after review
3. `3b8a239f` docs: archive spec/vocabulary-gap and spec/session-prompts
4. `488b71d5` docs: clean up build.md - move archived specs to Archived section

**Tags Created:**
- spec/repo-org-namespace
- spec/vocabulary-gap
- spec/session-prompts
