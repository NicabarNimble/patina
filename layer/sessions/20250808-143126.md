**Work completed:**
- Created pull request #9 to merge feat/navigation-system-sqlite-with-setup branch to main
- Fixed all Rust clippy warnings across the codebase
- Ensured proper code formatting for both Rust (cargo fmt) and Go (go fmt) code
- Verified all tests pass in both Rust and Go workspaces
- Prepared clean PR with all CI checks passing

**Key decisions:**
- Ran comprehensive pre-push checks to ensure CI pipeline would pass
- Used the project's pre-push-checks.sh script to validate everything locally first
- Followed the project's CI requirements strictly to avoid any pipeline failures

**Challenges faced:**
- Multiple clippy warnings needed fixing before PR could be created
- Had to ensure both Rust and Go code met formatting standards
- Needed to coordinate checks across multiple language workspaces

**Patterns observed:**
- The pre-push-checks.sh script is invaluable for catching issues before they hit CI
- Running local validation saves time and prevents failed CI runs
- Having a standardized check script ensures consistency across different development environments
