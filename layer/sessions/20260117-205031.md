## Previous Session Context
Last session explored beliefs as evidence linkage. Key insight: E3 isn't about indexing belief files for search, but about **beliefs as OUTPUT** - synthesized from scry/assay queries and linked back to evidence (sessions, commits, code). Confirmed scry (semantic) + assay (structural) complementary roles: scry finds "why we decided X" while assay proves "code reflects X". Multiple belief creation paths (manual E2, organic E4, query-driven E3) converge on evidence-grounded beliefs.

## Goals
- [ ] epistemic

## Activity Log
### 20:50 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: epistemic
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20260117-205031-claude-start


### 21:27 - Update (covering since session start)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 6
- Last commit: 12 hours ago

**Work Completed:**
- Reviewed `spec-epistemic-layer.md` and identified E2.5 was mostly complete
- Added session-belief feedback loop to `session-start.sh` (lines 181-202)
- Rebuilt and installed patina binary with updated templates
- Discovered and fixed template caching issue (`~/.patina/adapters/claude/templates/`)
- Updated spec: marked E2.5 tasks/exit criteria complete, added implementation notes

**Key Decisions:**
- E2.5 feedback loop should be informative, not judgmental (0 beliefs is fine for bug fixes)
- Display format: "📝 Previous session 'X' captured N belief(s):" or "no beliefs captured"
- Kept implementation simple: parse archived session file for "## Beliefs Captured:" section

**Challenges Faced:**
- Binary had new code but `patina adapter refresh` deployed old templates
- Root cause: Templates cached in `~/.patina/adapters/` weren't refreshed on rebuild
- Solution: `rm -rf ~/.patina/adapters/claude/templates` then refresh

**Patterns Observed:**
- `include_str!()` embeds at compile time, but cache must be cleared for changes to deploy
- `cargo clean` needed to force recompile of modules using `include_str!`
- Template deployment has two-layer caching: binary → ~/.patina/adapters/ → project


### 21:38 - Update (covering since 21:27)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        1
- Files changed: 1
- Last commit: 8 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
- Committed E2.5 changes: `19fd4238 feat(epistemic): complete E2.5 session-belief feedback loop`
- Verified spec updated correctly (progress line, tasks, exit criteria all marked complete)
- Discussed E3 Scry Integration - identified two approaches (simple indexing vs rich metadata)

**Next Steps Identified:**
- E3: Explore oxidize/scry architecture to understand belief indexing requirements
- Two approaches: simple (add beliefs to index) vs rich (parse frontmatter, surface confidence/evidence)
