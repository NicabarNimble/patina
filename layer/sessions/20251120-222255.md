## Previous Session Context
Developed comprehensive "One Engine, Variable Patina Thickness" architecture with progressive adapter design (E5-base-v2 frozen + 6 dimension adapters producing 2,304-dim embeddings). Established sessions as first-class deep context and primary training data source for thick patina. Unified adapter pattern at all levels (ML, system, architecture) enabling world model and similarity adapters to coexist with query routing by intent.

## Goals
- [ ] realign

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 2

**Work Completed:**

1. **Reviewed Recent Sessions and Core Docs**
   - Analyzed sessions 20251117-20251120 for architectural evolution
   - Reviewed all 7 layer/core docs against new vision
   - Identified gap: `patina-system-architecture.md` is v0.1.0 implementation doc, missing entire embedding/adapter vision

2. **Reorganized Core Documentation**
   - Moved `patina-system-architecture.md` from layer/core to layer/surface (it's implementation, not eternal principle)
   - Created `patina-embedding-architecture.md` (~450 lines) capturing:
     - Progressive adapter design (E5 frozen + 6 dimension adapters)
     - Why adapters vs fine-tuning
     - Training data sources per dimension
     - Patina thickness model
     - Mothership global adapter fallback
     - Three-tier project model
     - LiveStore event sourcing for adapters

3. **Explored OLMo 3 Models**
   - User shared AI2 video about OLMo 3 release
   - Researched whether OLMo could replace E5-base-v2
   - Confirmed OLMo is decoder-only (generation), not encoder (embeddings)
   - E5-base-v2 remains correct choice for embeddings
   - OLMo 7B-Instruct could be future local LLM adapter option

**Key Decisions:**

1. **Keep adapter-pattern.md focused on trait principle**
   - Don't dilute with ML adapter implementation details
   - ML adapters belong in surface architecture doc

2. **Surface vs Core distinction**
   - Core = eternal principles (dependable-rust, adapter-pattern)
   - Surface = implementation architecture being proven
   - Embedding architecture is emerging, not yet implemented → Surface

3. **Two architecture docs**
   - `patina-system-architecture.md` = v0.1.0 CLI implementation (what exists)
   - `patina-embedding-architecture.md` = v0.2 vision (what's designed)

**Patterns Observed:**

1. **Decoder vs Encoder Models**
   - Decoder-only (OLMo, GPT): Text generation, reasoning
   - Encoder-only (E5, BGE): Embeddings, retrieval
   - Different tools for different jobs

2. **AI2's "Model Flow" Philosophy**
   - Full transparency: data, code, checkpoints, training pipeline
   - Mirrors Patina's events-in-git approach
   - Kindred spirits in open development

**Status:**
- ✅ Core docs reorganized
- ✅ Embedding architecture documented
- 📋 Ready to commit checkpoint
