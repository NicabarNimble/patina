## Previous Session Context
Last session (spec-three-layers) attempted to refine the three-layer architecture document but ended early. Key insight: "mother" is shorthand for "mothership" (central vessel with probes spreading out and returning), which changes the spatial metaphor interpretation. User wanted document restructured as narrative → diagram → function → build steps, with narrative "bubbling up from code function" rather than imposed. No edits were made; the discussion direction wasn't landing well.

### 22:07 - Update (covering since 20:18)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 13
- Last commit: 15 hours ago

**Work Completed:**
- Blind read of spec-architectural-alignment.md and spec-three-layers.md
- Deep exploration of current codebase state (commands, line counts, structure)
- Discovered layer/dust/repos is legacy system replaced by `patina repo`
- Discovered audit.rs is hidden behind `--audit` flag, low value
- Created `spec-remove-legacy-repos-and-audit.md` - focused cleanup spec
- Updated `build.md` with current status and new spec reference
- Fixed fictional tag reference (spec/assay-refactoring didn't exist)

**Key Decisions:**
- Pivot from trying to clean up vision docs to cleaning up legacy code first
- User insight: "I want a doc that has exactly what is real NOW, then where I want to go FUTURE"
- spec-three-layers stays in workshop until vision solidifies - removed from build.md tracking
- Assay refactoring tracked in spec-architectural-alignment.md, not separate tag
- layer/dust/repos to be removed after adding `--status` to `patina repo` for feature parity

**Discussion Context:**
- User felt previous presentations were "missing" - diagnosed as organizing not thinking
- Shifted to asking user to explain in their own words what they wanted
- User clarified: doctor should be health checks across all three future binaries (mother/patina/awaken)
- audit is "dumb" - mechanical file categorization, overlaps with other tools

**Patterns Observed:**
- When presentations keep missing, ask user to reframe in their own words
- Don't reference git tags that don't exist in docs
- Verify doc claims against actual git history before finalizing
