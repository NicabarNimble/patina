# Session: unified-context-system
**ID**: 20250804-221314

**LLM**: claude

## Previous Session Context
Worked on implementing a git-aware navigation design using SQLite as the primary database. The session focused on using the git-aware-navigation-design-sqlite.md document as the source of truth to update the main git-aware-navigation-design.md file. Key work included database schema design and integration patterns for the navigation system.

## Goals
- [ ] unified-context-system

## Activity Log
### 22:13 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: unified-context-system


### 22:48 - Update (covering since 22:13)

**Work completed**:
- Created comprehensive design document for unified context system (`layer/surface/unified-context-system.md`)
- Developed architectural comparison between unified context approach and incremental enhancements (`layer/surface/unified-context-comparison.md`)
- Analyzed two competing philosophies: tightly integrated context graph vs Unix-style composable tools
- Evaluated both approaches against Patina's core principles (Unix philosophy, progressive disclosure)

**Key decisions**:
- Recommended incremental approach over unified context system to maintain simplicity
- Chose to prioritize Unix philosophy compliance over comprehensive AI awareness
- Decided navigation history tracking should be the first incremental enhancement
- Opted for loose coupling between features rather than tight integration

**Challenges faced**:
- Balancing ambitious vision of full context awareness with Patina's simplicity principles
- Designing a system that provides rich LLM context without overwhelming complexity
- Finding the right abstraction level for experiment tracking
- Determining how much automation vs explicit control users need

**Patterns observed**:
- Tension between "AI-first" and "human-first" design philosophies
- Small, focused improvements often deliver more value than grand architectures
- Unix philosophy serves as effective guard rail against feature creep
- Progressive disclosure principle helps prioritize which features to implement first
