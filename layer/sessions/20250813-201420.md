**LLM**: claude

## Previous Session Context
Successfully decomposed monolithic workspace into 5 modular components (environment-registry, git-manager, code-executor, environment-provider, api-gateway) following pattern-selection-framework. Achieved full feature parity while removing 3,493 lines of old code, with proper PID file management and production-ready process lifecycle.

## Goals
- [ ] Review recent code changes for quality and patterns
- [ ] Identify any issues or improvements needed
- [ ] Ensure alignment with Patina design principles

## Activity Log
### 20:14 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: recent


### 21:13 - Update (covering since 20:14)

**Work Completed:**
- Successfully created and merged PR #12 for modular architecture
- Fixed all CI failures (formatting, clippy warnings, tool_installer integration)
- Discovered tool_installer was disconnected during dependable-rust refactor
- Tested complete modular system functionality

**Key Technical Achievements:**
- Merged 3,493-line monolithic workspace deletion
- Deployed 1,405-line modular system (60% reduction)
- Validated all 5 modules work independently
- Confirmed PID file management works correctly
- Verified Git worktree integration functions properly

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- CI failures on formatting → ran cargo fmt --all
- Clippy uninlined format args → auto-fixed with --fix flag
- tool_installer unused code → traced history, found disconnect in refactor
- Service respawning issues → identified Go behavior, manageable

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Agent start/stop/status commands work
- ✅ Workspace creation with Git worktrees
- ✅ Multiple workspace management
- ✅ Clean deletion (except worktree cleanup needed)
- ❌ /exec endpoint not implemented yet

**Architecture Validation:**
- Eternal Tool pattern successful
- No circular dependencies achieved
- Clean module boundaries maintained
- API gateway coordination working
