## Previous Session Context
Previous session attempted to implement Mac app daemon architecture but discovered premature optimization. Started implementing HTTP daemon with tiny_http, hit SQLite threading issues, then realized the daemon was solving an invented problem. Refocused on core mission: build Ingest → Structure → Retrieve pipeline for project personas first, optimize performance later. All daemon code was reverted, working tree left clean.

## Goals
- [ ] new dawn peer review

### 07:04 - Update (covering since 12:51)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 2
- Last commit: 2 days ago

**Work Completed:**

1. **Cataloged and reviewed all "new-dawn" documents** (12:51-13:30)
   - Read 5 comprehensive documents totaling ~3,700 lines
   - Documents: EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY, DESIGN-PEER-REVIEW, PHASE1-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN, WEEK1-KICKOFF, COMPLETE-PHASE1-GUIDE
   - Analyzed scope: Event-sourced architecture with 5-week timeline, day-by-day implementation plan

2. **Conducted critical peer review** (13:30-15:30)
   - Evaluated what was genuinely novel vs. competent synthesis
   - Identified 15 critical gaps and misses in the review
   - Assessed: Architecture sound (5/5 stars technically) but repeats premature optimization pattern from previous session
   - Key finding: Documents propose 5-week build without validating retrieval hypothesis first

3. **Created comprehensive statement of work** (15:30-19:04)
   - Wrote 78-page modular peer review: `layer/surface/new-dawn/PEER-REVIEW-STATEMENT-OF-WORK.md`
   - Documented current state: 7 modules (A1-A7) with honest assessment of what works/doesn't
   - Proposed 9 independent topics with step-by-step implementation
   - Designed 5-phase approach starting with validation (Phase 0) before building

**Key Decisions:**

1. **Start with validation, not architecture** - Proposed Phase 0 (3-5 hours) to test current retrieval quality before committing to event sourcing
2. **Modular topics over monolithic plan** - Each of 9 topics can be discussed/adjusted independently
3. **Question-driven approach** - "Does provenance matter?" before "Build provenance system"
4. **Honest current state documentation** - Admitted "463 observations exist, quality unknown" vs. glossing over gaps
5. **Deferred nice-to-haves** - Persona (Phase 2), domain relationships (optional) until core proven

**Challenges Faced:**

1. **Balancing respect for junior work vs. critical truth** - Documents were well-crafted but missed core learning from previous session (premature optimization)
2. **Avoiding dismissiveness** - Had to acknowledge technical competence while pointing out lack of novelty
3. **Maintaining constructive tone** - User asked for brutal honesty ("be critical, I want the truth"), needed to deliver without being harsh

**Patterns Observed:**

1. **LLM-generated reviews lack self-awareness** - Junior assistant repeated pattern (big build without validation) that previous session explicitly rejected
2. **Comprehensive ≠ Insightful** - 3,700 lines of well-formatted documentation added project management scaffolding but no novel insights
3. **Architecture elegance ≠ User value** - Documents focused on event sourcing beauty, not retrieval quality improvement
4. **Modular SOW enables discussion** - Breaking work into 9 independent topics makes it easier to question/adjust each piece
5. **Validation-first prevents waste** - 3-5 hour spike to test hypothesis before 5-week build (80+ hour investment)

**Session Type:** REVIEW & DESIGN (analyzed external docs, created modular work plan)
