## Previous Session Context
Conducted deep spec review against codebase - mapped all 20 CLI commands to implementation status, identified 37 active/9 deferred/45 archived specs. Key work: created temporal query error analysis (root cause: sessions indexed but drowned by code in RRF fusion), converted surface-layer spec to new skill-like folder structure (feat/surface-layer/SPEC.md + design.md), and defined surface layer success metrics. Also discovered session detail degradation - Nov 2025 sessions had 25-52 observations vs Jan 2026's 10-16 (process issue, not tooling). Session recovered successfully after context wall hit.

## Goals
- [ ] spec review

## Activity Log
### 08:35 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: spec
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20260122-083510-claude-start


### 10:20 - Update (covering since session start)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 10
- Files changed: 50+
- Last commit: 6 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
- Deep spec analysis: compared 49 specs against actual code implementation
- Created 2 new specs: refactor/spec-system (format definition), refactor/reports-layer (PROOF on surface)
- Archived 17 completed specs (git tags already existed, files deleted)
- Fixed 2 lying specs (bootstrap-markers said "active" but was implemented)
- Deleted 2 superseded specs (adapter-non-destructive, refactor-layer-organization)
- Deferred 11 design specs (moved to deferred/)
- Reorganized reports: eval content → layer/surface/reports/eval/
- Created 3 beliefs: truthful-specs, archive-completed-work, one-format-not-many
- Added belief capture checkpoint to session-update for all adapters

**Key Decisions:**
- One spec format, not many - folder structure (SPEC.md + optional design.md)
- Status enum: design | ready | in_progress | complete | archived
- PROOF belongs on surface layer (reports/), not buried in tool outputs
- Belief capture needs process checkpoint, not just tooling

**Patterns Observed:**
- Specs that lie (unchecked boxes for completed work) actively mislead
- Tags existed for archived specs but files were never deleted - hygiene gap
- Belief capture rate was low because skill wasn't triggered, not because tooling missing
