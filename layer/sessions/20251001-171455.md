## Previous Session Context
Completed all 9 language extractions (Solidity and Cairo). Implemented Phase 2 of reference repository management with batch scraping capabilities (`patina scrape code --repo all` and `--repo doctor` for STALE repos). Successfully tested on 12 repositories, extracting semantic facts for LLM code generation. All languages now have comprehensive extraction of inheritance, trait implementations, and struct fields.

## Goals
- [ ] work PR

### 20:32 - Update (covering since 17:14)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        2
- Files changed: 0
- Last commit: 2 hours ago

**Work completed:**
- Fixed all clippy warnings (unused variables in Go/Python extractors, function complexity in C++)
- Ran pre-push checks to verify CI compliance (all tests passing, zero warnings)
- Created and merged PR #25 into main (33 commits covering language extraction and repo management)
- Synced work branch with main after merge
- All 9 language extractions now in production with comprehensive semantic fact extraction

**Key decisions:**
- Prefixed unused variables with underscore rather than removing them (preserves parsing structure)
- Refactored C++ function processor to use tuple parameter instead of 8 separate params (clippy compliance)
- Chose not to include AI attribution in commit messages per project guidelines
- Fast-forward merge to keep work and main in sync after PR merge

**Challenges faced:**
- Initial commit attempt included Claude Code attribution which violated project guidelines
- Had to understand difference between work branch commits and merge commit on main
- Clippy warnings required careful fixes to maintain code functionality while satisfying linter

**Patterns observed:**
- Pre-push check script catches all CI issues before GitHub sees them (excellent workflow)
- Unused variable extraction code preserved for future enhancement (underscore prefix documents intent)
- GitHub merge commits create divergence between branches - fast-forward merge resolves cleanly
- Todo list tracking helped manage multi-step PR process systematically
