## Previous Session Context
Fixed automation repo PR #1 CI checks and merged to main. Explored neuro-symbolic persona system architecture: domain buckets containing facts.db + rules.pl as canonical data, with markdown as generated output only. Key unsolved challenge identified: cross-domain linking between persona buckets.

## Goals
- [ ] Neuro Symbolic Ai github and patina

**Work Completed:**
- Reviewed git history and recent layer/sessions to understand neuro-symbolic persona context
- Installed Scryer Prolog (v0.10.0) via Homebrew on Apple Silicon
- Created proof-of-concept domain bucket (layer/buckets/patina-dev/)
- Manually extracted facts from 7 recent sessions into facts.pl (sessions, patterns, technologies, decisions, challenges)
- Wrote Prolog inference rules (rules.pl) for pattern evolution, session classification, technology analysis
- Tested Scryer Prolog queries successfully (security_session, pattern_in_category, architecture_session)
- Created queries.md with working examples and query cookbook
- Designed full SQLite + Prolog integration architecture (DESIGN.md)
- Explored LLM extraction pipeline (session markdown → structured facts)

**Key Decisions:**
- **Scryer Prolog over SWI-Prolog**: Written in Rust, aligns with Patina philosophy, modern ISO Prolog
- **SQLite + Prolog hybrid**: SQLite for efficient storage/queries, Prolog for logical inference
- **Prolog imports for cross-domain linking**: Self-contained buckets with clear dependencies (recommended solution)
- **LLM extracts, Prolog infers**: Clear separation - LLM reads prose and extracts structured facts, Prolog applies logical rules to infer knowledge
- **Manual extraction first**: Validated approach with 7 sessions before building automation

**Challenges Faced:**
- Initial Scryer Prolog errors: consult/1 directive not working, length/2 not found
- Solved by removing consult directive and simplifying rules (avoiding findall/length for basic queries)
- Scryer Prolog format/2 type errors with string literals
- Confusion about extraction vs inference roles (LLM vs Prolog)
- Uncertainty about core/surface/dust movement vs domain-centric persona model
- Struggled to articulate clear mental model for how pieces fit together

**Patterns Observed:**
- **Neuro-symbolic architecture**: Neural (LLM) extracts facts from unstructured text, Symbolic (Prolog) infers conclusions from structured facts
- **Schema-driven extraction**: Questions we want to answer determine what facts to extract
- **Session structure enables extraction**: Consistent sections (Patterns Observed, Key Decisions, Challenges Faced) map to database tables
- **Proof-of-concept validates approach**: Manual extraction of 7 sessions demonstrated viability before automation
- **Mental model clarity crucial**: Technical implementation less important than clear conceptual understanding of system purpose
