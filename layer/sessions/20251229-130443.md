**Git Branch**: patina
**Session Tag**: session-20251229-130443-start

## Previous Session Context
Last session (spec-architectural-alignment) was a deep architectural discovery that defined the **three-layer architecture**: mother (persona/orchestration), patina (knowledge/RAG), and awaken (action/deployment). Created `spec-three-layers.md` as the north star architecture document with the Hyperion-inspired narrative: "Mother watches from orbit. Patina spreads to every project...". Key decisions included three separate binaries from one crate, smart resolution CLI for awaken (project optional), and clear separation of concerns.

## Goals
- [ ] Refine spec-three-layers document
- [ ] spec-three-layers

## Activity Log
### 13:04 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: spec-three-layers
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20251229-130443-start

### 13:04-13:30 - Discussion: Refining spec-three-layers.md

**Context Gathered:**
- Read layer/core values (dependable-rust, unix-philosophy, adapter-pattern)
- Read recent sessions (spec-architectural-alignment, release-plz fix)
- Read current spec-three-layers.md

**Key Discussion Points:**
- User wants document restructured: narrative → diagram → function → build steps
- Narrative should "bubble up from code function, not be imposed"
- Front narrative should be "evocative but not lies"
- Function descriptions should "tie back to narrative but be factual"
- "The code proves the story. The story compresses the code."

**Important Context Discovered:**
- "Mother" is shorthand for "mothership" - changes interpretation of "watches from orbit"
- Mothership pattern: central vessel, probes spread out and return
- This reframes the spatial metaphor as potentially grounded

**Session Ended Early:**
- User not liking the direction of the discussion
- No edits were made to spec-three-layers.md
- Needs rest, will revisit

**Key Insight for Next Session:**
The narrative may be more grounded than initially assessed once "mothership" context is understood. But user felt the discussion direction was off - need to approach differently next time.
