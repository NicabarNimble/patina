## Previous Session Context
Last session discovered git history as the primary knowledge source for ref repos ("README is marketing, git is truth"). Key accomplishments: removed shallow clone to capture full git history (now ~47k commits, ~540k co-change relationships across 13 ref repos), prototyped moment detection SQL (genesis, big bangs, breaking changes), and updated spec-mothership.md with temporal narrative, moments.usearch storage, and Phase 0: Git Narrative as current focus. The A/B test plan: (A) ref repos with git-only narrative vs (B) patina with git + sessions to measure what sessions add.

## Goals
- [x] Complete Phase 0 Git Narrative - all 6 deliverables
- [x] Make commit messages searchable via FTS5
- [x] Implement moments detection (temporal signals)
- [x] Update spec and build.md

## Activity Log
### 06:13 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: mothership ref repo design
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20260102-061346-start

### 07:07 - Session Complete

**Completed Phase 0 Git Narrative (all 6 deliverables):**

1. **commits_fts table** - FTS5 index on commit messages
2. **scrape integration** - populate_commits_fts5() called after git scrape
3. **LexicalOracle** - now searches commits_fts alongside code_fts
4. **moments table** - schema for temporal signals
5. **assay derive-moments** - CLI command to compute moments
6. **Exit criteria verified** - scry returns commits, moments detected

**Key Design Decision:** Separated commits_fts from code_fts (different semantic domains). Moments are derived signals from commits (genesis, big_bang, major, breaking, migration, rewrite).

**Tested on dojo:**
- 2702 commit messages indexed
- 380 moments detected (1 genesis, 12 big_bang, 27 major, 3 breaking, 37 migration, 300 rewrite)
- `scry "breaking" --hybrid` returns actual breaking change commits

**Git Activity:**
- 6 commits this session
- Clean working tree
