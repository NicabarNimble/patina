## Previous Session Context
Previous session explored context7 and determined it wasn't needed. Key insight was that storing code samples could be valuable for future reference, but the context7 approach itself wasn't the right solution.

## Goals
- [x] remove code_fingerprints

## Activity Log
### 22:08 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: remove code_fingerprints
Working on branch: llm-pattern-detection
Tagged as: session-20250902-220824-start


### 22:45 - Update (covering since 22:08)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 2
- Files changed: 2 (code.rs, llm-code-intelligence-design.md)
- Last commit: 38 seconds ago

**Work Completed:**
- Successfully removed code_fingerprints table and all related code
- Deleted entire fingerprint module (170+ lines of hash computation)
- Updated stats queries to use meaningful tables (function_facts, type_vocabulary, import_facts)
- Removed all INSERT statements, table creation, indexes
- Tested scrape command - working correctly

**Key Decisions:**
- Followed LLM Code Intelligence design doc (rated code_fingerprints 0/10 usefulness)
- Kept useful fact tables, removed meaningless pattern hashes
- Focus on extracting facts about how code is written, not arbitrary hashes

**Branch Management:**
- Merged llm-pattern-detection into work branch
- Created new refactor-remove-fingerprints branch
- Clean refactor with single focused commit
