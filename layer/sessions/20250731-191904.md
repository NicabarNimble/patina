## Previous Session Context
The last session "new" (layer/sessions/20250731-164959.md) appears to have been a brief session without documented activities or patterns. It was likely an initialization or test session.

## Goals
- [ ] test disconnect without session end

## Activity Log
### 19:19 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: test


### 19:24 - Update (covering since 19:19)
- Tested disconnect/reconnect behavior of session management
- Discovered that session-start.sh intelligently handles incomplete sessions:
  - Sessions with >10 lines are archived via silent session-end
  - Sessions with ≤10 lines are simply deleted
- Confirmed the old active-session.md was deleted (not archived) due to minimal content
- Successfully demonstrated session resilience to connection interruptions
