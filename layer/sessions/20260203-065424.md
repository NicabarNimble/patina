## Previous Session Context
Deep-dived into Mother architecture (1,849 lines Rust built), OpenClaw (mandatory recall pattern, two-step search), and Gastown (ephemeral context injection, role-based delivery). Synthesized these into the [[mother-delivery]] spec (`layer/surface/build/feat/mother-delivery/SPEC.md`) with 5 design changes (D1-D5), updated parent Mother spec to redefine v0.11.0 as "Delivery + Federation", and wired spec into build.md and v1-release. Committed as [[e8d26665]]. Left 3 open design questions to sleep on: D1 BeliefOracle approach (separate oracle vs SQLite FTS5 vs better tagging), D3 two-step scope (snippets for MCP, full for CLI), and recall directive placement strategy.
