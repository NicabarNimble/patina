## Previous Session Context
Last session "deep" mapped all 22 CLI commands and identified 1,715 lines of dead code in src/storage/, src/reasoning/, and src/query/ - the remnants of a Nov 2025 Prolog-based neuro-symbolic system that was never integrated. Key insight captured as belief: compose-over-build (composed solutions improve when components improve; parallel systems don't). Designed a belief validation system spec that uses existing tools (scry, git, grep) rather than building parallel infrastructure.

## Goals
- [x] Remove Prolog/neuro-symbolic dead code with strong Git archive

## Activity Log
### 09:13 - Session Start

### 09:39 - Update (covering since 09:13)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 7
- Files changed: 8
- Last commit: 41 seconds ago

**Work Completed:**
1. Created archive tag `archive/prolog-exploration-2025-11` to preserve code before deletion
2. Moved `architecture-neuro-symbolic.md` to `layer/dust/architecture/` (path not taken)
3. Phase 1: Deleted `src/reasoning/` + removed `scryer-prolog` dependency (1130 lines)
4. Phase 2: Deleted `src/storage/` (800 lines)
5. Phase 3: Deleted `src/query/` + test files (650 lines)
6. Phase 4: Deleted `examples/semantic_search_demo.rs` (82 lines)
7. Verified build, tests, and clippy all pass
8. Deep dive: tested all 22 CLI commands work correctly
9. Ran `patina scrape --rebuild` to clean stale index entries
10. Ran `patina oxidize` to rebuild all embeddings
11. Created spec tag `spec/remove-neuro-symbolic-debt` and updated build.md

**Key Decisions:**
- Strong archive approach: git tag + dust folder (not just "trust git history")
- Scalpel commits: 7 small focused commits instead of one big deletion
- Delete entire `src/query/` module (not just semantic_search.rs) since it only contained dead code

**Patterns Observed:**
- compose-over-build validated: deleted parallel system, kept composed retrieval
- Read before write: reviewed each module before deletion
- Phased deletion: leaf modules first, then dependents

**Commits:**
- fd97ea7a refactor(layer): archive neuro-symbolic architecture doc
- 4e7a7086 refactor: remove Prolog reasoning engine (Phase 1)
- 02bfbc7c refactor: remove storage module (Phase 2)
- c67973f2 refactor: remove query module (Phase 3)
- b1f054ed refactor: remove semantic search demo (Phase 4)
- bdc3403a docs: mark neuro-symbolic removal spec as complete
- e0f7fa77 docs: archive spec/remove-neuro-symbolic-debt

**Total removed:** ~2,660 lines of dead code + heavy scryer-prolog dependency
