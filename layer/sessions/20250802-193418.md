## Previous Session Context
The last session focused on creating a new development session for exploring patterns. It appears to have been a brief session that ended at 17:47, with the session archived to layer/sessions/20250802-174710.md for future reference.

## Goals
- [ ] Test the Claude hooks system
- [ ] Explore git integration capabilities
- [ ] Document findings and patterns

## Activity Log
### 19:34 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: git


### 21:38 - Update (covering since 19:34)

**Work completed:**
- Investigated and documented Patina's git hooks system architecture
- Fixed hooks configuration to match Claude Code's expected format
- Cleaned up old/dead hook configuration files
- Discovered fragmented work across multiple feature branches
- Created new consolidated branch with git scripts properly organized
- Added documentation for hooks setup

**Key decisions and reasoning:**
- Keep hooks configuration local (.claude/) since it's developer-specific
- Accept jq as dependency for hooks (aligns with Claude Code examples)
- Consolidate scattered work into clean branch rather than cherry-pick
- Separate versioned resources (scripts) from local config (hooks.json)

**Challenges faced and solutions:**
- Hooks weren't triggering → Fixed JSON configuration format
- Work scattered across branches → Created consolidation branch
- Lost context between branches → Identified as fundamental AI/git issue
- Missing git scripts in resources/ → Pulled from feat/git-workflow-integration

**Patterns observed:**
- AI context doesn't travel with git branches (major workflow issue)
- .claude/ being gitignored creates context isolation
- Hook-based automation enables non-intrusive git awareness
- Simple solutions (one hook file) better than complex (multiple configs)
