## Previous Session Context
Continuation of 0.9.2 hardening session. Earlier in this conversation: ran `patina doctor` (found session count bug), `patina adapter refresh claude` (found gitignore bug), deep review identified 9 session system issues, fixed scry/MCP session ID lookup and tag collision guard, created fix spec and version semver alignment spec, discussed version model (milestones→MINOR, fixes→PATCH).

## Goals
- [x] Land remaining fix spec code fixes (#5, #6, #7)
- [x] Cross-adapter testing (gemini, opencode)
- [x] Scraper round-trip verification

## Activity Log
### 14:50 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: Session 0.9.2 hardening - continued
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20260131-145024-claude-start


### 14:59 - Update (covering since 14:50)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 1
- Files changed: 0
- Last commit: 3 minutes ago

**Work completed:**
- Landed fixes #5 (starting commit after branch switch), #6 (incomplete session archive status→archived), #7 (tighten patterns_modified to layer/core|surface|topics only)
- Cross-adapter test: gemini and opencode full lifecycle (start→update→note→end) passed
- Scraper round-trip: 548 sessions, 2784 observations, zero errors on `--full` scrape
- Confirmed issue #6 in practice: force-archived session had `status: active` before fix

**Key decisions:**
1. Version model: shift milestones to MINOR, reserve PATCH for fixes (specced, not implemented)
2. Fix specs get `affects_since` field to link to the version that introduced the bug
3. Old numbering (0.9.0-0.9.2) stays as-is — no history renumbering
