## Previous Session Context
Last session fixed Patina adapter refresh - root cause was stale cache at `~/.patina/adapters/`. Fixed by always refreshing from embedded templates in `copy_to_project()`. Also fixed CLAUDE.md overwrite bug with marker-based updates (`<!-- PATINA:START -->...<!-- PATINA:END -->`), added proactive belief detection to epistemic-beliefs skill, and completed the org/repo namespace migration. 4 commits total. Open items: uncommitted changes remain in `internal.rs` and `mod.rs`.

## Goals
- [ ] skills beliefs and specs

## Activity Log
### 16:55 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: skills
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20260120-165543-claude-start


### 17:43 - Note [patina@95f8c024]
Skill architecture for specs/build system: Sessions are freeform thinking spaces (stay messy). Specs should use skill-like organization: folder structure as routing (feat/, fix/, refactor/ like conventional commits), SPEC.md as progressive disclosure entry point (summary + status), design.md for details. Key insight: skills are organizational pattern, not generative target - don't derive 1000s of skills from beliefs. Beliefs stay searchable via scry. Few high-value skills wrap Patina CLI. Problem identified: exploratory sessions fail to capture insights, docs/specs lose thread, context crashes lose knowledge. Solution: enhance session-end distillation to prompt for belief/decision capture.

### 21:15 - Update (covering since 16:55)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 0
- Files changed: 6
- Last commit: 7 hours ago

**Work Completed:**
- Deep dive into specs, beliefs, and skills architecture
- Recovered lost conversation context from cached discussion about skill organization
- Updated `spec-spec-as-skill.md` with HuggingFace skills pattern (folder-based routing, SPEC.md + design.md progressive disclosure, conventional commit alignment)
- Created new refactor spec: `refactor/remove-neuro-symbolic-debt/` (SPEC.md + design.md)
- Added refactor to build.md as next up
- Investigated "unused" Rust code (src/storage/, src/reasoning/, src/query/semantic_search.rs)
- Traced full belief flow: scrape layer → patterns table → oxidize → semantic.usearch → scry finds beliefs
- Confirmed beliefs ARE searchable (sync-first found with score 0.892)

**Key Decisions:**
- Specs should use skill architecture: folder structure = routing (feat/, fix/, refactor/)
- SPEC.md is summary (like SKILL.md), design.md is deep details (like references/)
- "Skills are organizational patterns, not generative targets" - don't derive 1000s of skills from beliefs
- Sessions stay freeform (messy is the feature), improve distillation at end
- ~1900 lines of Nov 2025 neuro-symbolic code is true tech debt (parallel implementation never integrated)

**Challenges Faced:**
1. Lost thread on skill architecture discussion - recovered from cached conversation
2. Initially thought beliefs weren't searchable - traced full flow and confirmed they work
3. Confusion about what Rust code does - mapped active system vs unused parallel implementation

**Patterns Observed:**
- Active system (eventlog → patterns → oxidize → scry) works; parallel system (BeliefStorage, ReasoningEngine) unused
- HuggingFace skills repo provides excellent reference for progressive disclosure pattern
- Conventional commit types (feat/, fix/, refactor/) map naturally to spec organization
- Session notes capture key insights that would otherwise be lost in context crashes
