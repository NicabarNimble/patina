## Previous Session Context
The last session successfully created PR #9 to merge feat/navigation-system-sqlite-with-setup to main. Fixed all clippy warnings, ensured proper formatting for both Rust and Go code, and verified all tests pass before creating the PR with clean CI checks.

## Goals
- [ ] main and direction review

## Activity Log
### 05:52 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: main and direction review


### 11:50 - Update (covering since 05:52)

**Work completed:**
- Created new `dependable-rust` branch and committed Dependable Rust architecture document
- Conducted exhaustive review of Patina codebase against Dependable Rust principles
- Revised Dependable Rust document to incorporate Black-Box Refactor Playbook insights
- Updated terminology from "Brain" to "Layer" system throughout document
- Replaced abstract "contract" language with concrete Rust terms (trait, API, mod.rs)

**Key decisions:**
- Black-box ownership model: One dev owns each module (trait + implementation)
- Use `mod.rs` as the natural interface definition (Rust-idiomatic)
- Small trait surfaces (<150 lines) matter more than file sizes
- Implementations can be large when hidden behind traits

**Challenges and solutions:**
- Initial confusion about ownership model → Clarified that box owner defines AND owns the API
- Abstract "contract" terminology → Replaced with concrete Rust terms (trait, API)
- Outdated "Brain" references → Updated to current "Layer" system (core/surface/dust)

**Patterns observed:**
- Traits in Rust serve the same role as header files in C (interface definition)
- Black-box boundaries enable large implementations with small public surfaces
- Single ownership per module maintains conceptual integrity
- The oxidation metaphor (surface → core → dust) reflects natural knowledge evolution
