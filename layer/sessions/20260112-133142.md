# Session: spec-init-hardening
**ID**: 20260112-133142
**Started**: 2026-01-12T18:31:42Z
**LLM**: claude
**Git Branch**: patina
**Session Tag**: session-20260112-133142-start
**Starting Commit**: 888d9b6928c8211e01baf9924ea41a9406a6173f

## Previous Session Context
Last session (20260112-115222) completed comprehensive spec-init-hardening work: added `frontend refresh` command, edge cases section (hierarchy conflicts, git states, gitignore, backup handling), and commit behavior (auto-commit per command with `--no-commit` escape hatch). Key decisions: Patina is git-native (init creates repo if missing), MCP config is best-effort with deferred fix, walkthroughs drove spec refinement. Committed as `888d9b69`.

### 15:40 - Update (covering since 13:31)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 2
- Last commit: 2 hours ago

**Work Completed:**
- Deep codebase review of spec-init-hardening.md against actual implementation
- Identified that spec was framed as greenfield when most infrastructure exists
- Major spec reorganization: added "Goals", "What Exists Today", "What We Need to Build" sections
- Resolved terminology: kept `adapter` instead of renaming to `frontend`
- Updated all references: `[frontends]` → `[adapters]` in config, command examples, event types
- Simplified Implementation Phases to reflect refactoring (not new builds)
- Updated Files to Modify section with accurate file paths

**Key Decisions:**
1. **Keep `adapter` terminology** - Already implemented, matches `LLMAdapter` trait, no migration needed
2. **Spec is refactoring** - Most code exists; init needs stripping, adapter needs 2 new subcommands
3. **Config rename** - `[frontends]` → `[adapters]` for internal consistency

**Patterns Observed:**
- Spec was written as if designing from scratch, but codebase review revealed 80%+ exists
- "What exists vs what to build" framing makes scope crystal clear
- Terminology decisions should check existing code first (avoid unnecessary renames)


### 15:41 - Final Update

**Work Completed:**
- Session wrap-up, no additional changes since last update
