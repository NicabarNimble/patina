## Previous Session Context
Ran full Andrew Ng review of belief verification: 47 queries, 46 pass, 1 contested (`archive-completed-work`). Investigated the contested finding, discovered specs now use `status: complete` in-tree rather than moving to `layer/dust/`, built and shipped `patina spec archive <id>` command to automate the tag-remove-update lifecycle, archived 5 completed specs, and bumped to v0.9.4. Two E4.5 exit criteria remain open: (1) user sign-off on "maintaining beliefs feels effortless" and (2) testing verification on at least 1 reference repo.

## Goals
- [x] Close E4.5 belief-verification — all exit criteria met, SPEC archived
- [x] Update epistemic-layer SPEC — sync E4.5, add E4.6, expand E5
- [x] Capture spec drift belief — stale-context-is-hostile-context
- [x] Wire up build.md for next session — drift spec first, then E4.6
- [x] Pre-push checks passing (298 tests, clippy clean)

## Activity Log

### 09:30-11:00 — E4.5 close-out + deep review

**Work completed:**
- Read full belief-verification SPEC (877 lines). Closed 2 remaining exit criteria:
  1. "Maintaining these 4 feels effortless" — user confirmed, checked off
  2. "Verification system works on at least 1 ref repo" — closed by code review. Engine internals
     (parse.rs, assay.rs, temporal.rs, safety.rs) contain zero Patina-specific paths. Ref repo
     test would be contrived. Forward reference to E4.6/mother for real cross-repo verification.
- Flipped SPEC status: building → complete. Archived via `patina spec archive belief-verification`.
- Updated build.md: milestones current (0.9.4), removed stale refs (verification-module-split,
  reports-layer), updated epistemic progress from "E0-E3, 35 beliefs" to "E0-E4.5, 46 beliefs".

**Deep exploration — two threads from user:**

1. **Multi-project beliefs via mother**: Explored ref repo belief architecture. Ref repos are
   scraped into their own DBs but have no beliefs. User clarified the designed system: each
   project has own beliefs + shared beliefs across projects, mother knows cross-project state,
   ref repos are read-only sources to learn from. Gap: no mechanism for beliefs scoped to a
   specific repo's DB. Mother federation (0.11.0) is where this gets solved.

2. **Epistemic graph — metadata vs computation**: Explored supports/attacks/entrenchment in code.
   All are display-only — cross_reference_beliefs() counts all citations equally (+1), doesn't
   distinguish supports from attacks, no graph traversal exists. E5 (revision) and E6 (curation)
   are planned stubs. User asked: have we abandoned semantic validation? Answer: E4/E4.5 was a
   measurement side-quest, not the destination. The graph work is future, not abandoned.

**Epistemic-layer SPEC major update:**
- Compressed E4.5 from 150 lines of stale design context to 20-line outcome summary
- Added E4.6: restructured as E4.6a (belief↔code/commit/session grounding) + E4.6b (belief↔belief
  similarity). User insight: grounding precedes clustering, and both ground mother's future design.
- Expanded E5: within-project revision + transitive reasoning + cross-project belief routing
- Updated statistics to Feb 2 reality (46 beliefs, 47 queries)

**Spec drift discovery — the session's key insight:**
- Epistemic-layer SPEC had E4.5 marked "exploring" when it was complete with 28 build steps
- Build.md showed 35 beliefs (actual: 46), milestones 2 versions behind
- User articulated: "you can hold many timelines and I cannot, but you need the organization to
  resurface those timelines as your memory completely goes away. Most of what Patina is to become
  is this symbiotic relationship — the layer of understanding guided by a user for LLMs to use
  as a reboot of context."
- This is Patina's core challenge: stale context poisons LLM reboots. Not a doc maintenance
  problem — a fundamental break in the human/LLM symbiotic relationship.

**Semantic grounding insight (late in session):**
- User asked about belief↔oxidized embeddings. Explored: all 5 content types share the same
  256-dim cosine vector space. usearch supports .get(id) + .search() for kNN. The infrastructure
  to answer "which code is this belief about?" exists — just not connected.
- Restructured E4.6 to start with grounding (belief↔code) before clustering (belief↔belief).

**Beliefs captured: 1 new, 1 revised**
- `stale-context-is-hostile-context` — stale specs are worse than no specs for LLM collaboration
- `practical-memory-over-epistemic-formalism` — scoped: "not a knowledge graph" too absolute,
  E4.6 semantic measurement is practical not formalism

**Clippy/fmt fixes:** belief audit literal strings, needless range loop in cross_reference_beliefs

**10 commits:**
1. `cdf37fb` spec(complete): close belief-verification
2. `6cb7976` chore: Cargo.lock + session file
3. (spec archive commit + tag)
4. `27d694a` docs: update build.md
5. `b599fc6` spec(epistemic): sync E4.5, add E4.6, expand E5
6. `cd95599` belief: stale-context-is-hostile-context + scope practical-memory
7. `1fea8e8` fix: clippy + fmt
8. `4e075c3` spec(epistemic): restructure E4.6 — grounding before clustering
9. `a295ac0` docs: wire up next session

**Next session priorities (in build.md):**
1. Write spec for spec drift detection (before new features)
2. E4.6a — semantic belief grounding (belief↔code/commit/session)
3. E4.6b — belief-to-belief similarity + typed edges
