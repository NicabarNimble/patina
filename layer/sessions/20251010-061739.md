## Previous Session Context
Created public automation repo (NicabarNimble/automation) with repo-cleanup workflow that scans 134+ repos and populates GitHub Project #4. Implemented comprehensive CI pipeline (security, bash lint, YAML, markdown, script tests) with branch protection on patina branch. Documented patina branching strategy (patina = stable working branch, main = situational) and adopted Patina layer/ system for documentation.

## Goals
- [ ] github

## Activity Log
### 06:17 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: github
Working on branch: feature/repo-cleanup-action
Tagged as: session-20251010-061739-start


### 10:05 - Note [feature/repo-cleanup-action@80f57e9]
Explored neuro-symbolic persona system: domain buckets (facts.db + rules.pl), persona sessions for formalization, LLM becomes persona by loading canonical data. Markdown is generated output only. Cross-domain linking still unsolved.

### 11:35 - Update (covering since 06:17)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 5
- Last commit: 26 hours ago

**Work Completed:**
- Reviewed Git history and recent layer/sessions to understand automation repo context
- Fixed stalled PR #1 in automation repo (CI checks not running due to workflow timing)
- Closed and reopened PR to trigger CI checks
- Fixed 60 markdown linting errors using markdownlint-cli2 (installed via brew)
- Auto-fixed 59 errors with --fix, manually fixed 1 line-length issue
- All CI checks now passing (security, bash lint, YAML, markdown, script tests)
- PR merged to main, automation repo updated, test branch deleted
- Explored neuro-symbolic AI architecture for Patina persona system

**Key Decisions:**
- Used markdownlint-cli2 --fix for bulk fixing instead of manual edits (more efficient)
- Tested Obsidian syntax compatibility with markdownlint (mostly safe, callouts have issues)
- Clarified persona system architecture: facts.db + rules.pl are canonical, markdown is generated output only
- Domain buckets are self-contained with SQLite + Prolog + optional generated markdown
- Cross-domain linking problem identified as key unsolved challenge

**Challenges Faced:**
- Initial confusion about why PR checks weren't running (workflow needs to exist on base branch before PR creation)
- Started manually editing markdown files one by one (inefficient approach, corrected to use auto-fix)
- Multiple iterations to understand persona system architecture (markdown role, domain bucket structure)

**Patterns Observed:**
- GitHub Actions workflows must exist on base branch to trigger on PRs
- Close/reopen PR is simple fix for workflow timing issues
- markdownlint-cli2 can auto-fix most formatting issues safely
- Obsidian callouts syntax conflicts with MD028 rule (blank lines in blockquotes)
- Persona system architecture: canonical data (facts+rules) separate from derived artifacts (markdown)
- Neuro-symbolic AI pattern: LLM (neural) + Prolog (symbolic) running on Apple Silicon
