## Previous Session Context
The last session "refactor" completed successfully. The session focused on removing dead commands (add, commit, push) from the codebase, cleaning up references, and applying cargo fmt. All changes were merged via PR #5.

## Goals
- [ ] scrape the layers

## Activity Log
### 21:58 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: scrape the layers


### 00:25 - Update (covering since 21:58)

**Work completed:**
- Discovered knowledge-oxidation.md was missing (PR #6 not pulled locally)
- Updated local main branch to recover the file
- Deep analysis of layer design breakthrough and oxidation patterns
- Created `patina layer` command structure with 7 subcommands
- Realized we violated Unix philosophy (empty commands that do nothing)
- Pivoted to discussing how to make markdown searchable and organize domains
- Major breakthrough: core/surface/dust layer structure based on oxidation states
- Documented layer structure evolution in new PR #7
- Successfully merged PR #7 after tests passed

**Key decisions:**
- Layer structure should reflect oxidation states, not arbitrary topics
- Core = patterns actively in code (living truth)
- Surface = active work with raw/ for sessions
- Dust = valuable archive (not trash)
- Domains form organically in surface based on actual use
- Early projects have volatile cores, mature projects have stable cores

**Challenges faced:**
- Context explosion in current layer system (68 files, many duplicates)
- How to make markdown both human and machine readable
- Naming domains without being prescriptive
- Understanding that Patina needs to solve its own problem

**Patterns observed:**
- Knowledge naturally oxidizes like patina on metal
- Some oxidation protects (good patterns), some obscures (outdated info)
- Raw → Surface → Core/Dust is the natural flow
- Database future: active stays in filesystem, dust blows to rqlite
- Each Patina project is its own domain with unique truths
