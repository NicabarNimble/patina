## Previous Session Context
Completed reorganization of the scrape command into a 9-chapter structure with clear dependencies. Added git freshness checking to alert users about stale repository states before scraping patterns.

## Goals
- [ ] Clean up the commands module
- [ ] Improve command structure and organization
- [ ] Address any dead code or unused commands
- [ ] Ensure consistent error handling across commands

### 22:30 - Update (covering since 14:11)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        5
- Files changed: 0
- Last commit: 6 minutes ago

**Work completed:**
- Removed 10,358 lines of experimental/dead code across 3 major rounds
- Round 1: Pattern recognition experiments (trace, recognize, connect, organize, hook) - 5,776 lines
- Round 2: Navigate command and entire indexer module - 3,451 lines  
- Round 3: Memory module, simple-analyze binary, test files - 1,129 lines
- Updated CLAUDE.md and README.md to reflect current functionality
- Successfully created and merged PR #21

**Key decisions:**
- Identified pattern recognition as abandoned direction (Aug 2025 experiments)
- Navigate was overengineered markdown search - scrape with DuckDB is the future
- Memory module was completely unused experimental code
- Kept agent command as it's used by build/test for Dagger orchestration

**Challenges faced:**
- Initial CI failure due to formatting (extra blank lines)
- Had to be careful to EDIT not DELETE critical docs (README, CLAUDE.md)
- Port mismatch discovered between agent (8091) and dagger.rs (8080)

**Patterns observed:**
- Patina had accumulated many experimental directions that didn't pan out
- The codebase is now focused on core working functionality
- Future direction is clear: scrape with DuckDB for unified semantic indexing
