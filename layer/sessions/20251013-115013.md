## Previous Session Context
Created proof-of-concept neuro-symbolic persona system for Patina using Scryer Prolog + SQLite. Manually extracted facts from 7 sessions into facts.pl and wrote inference rules. Key decisions: Scryer Prolog (Rust-based) over SWI-Prolog, Prolog imports for cross-domain linking, LLM extracts facts from prose while Prolog handles logical inference. Main unsolved challenge: building the automated LLM extraction pipeline to replace manual fact extraction.

## Goals
- [ ] neurosymbolic

## Activity Log

### 17:02 - Update (covering since 11:50)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        3
- Files changed: 0
- Last commit: 4 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
- Reviewed git history and 227+ session files to understand Patina's evolution
- Created comprehensive 1,770-line architecture document in `layer/core/patina-system-architecture.md`
- Tested and merged YOLO devcontainer generation feature (PR #36)
  - Fixed CI issues (cargo fmt, clippy warnings)
  - Tested on 4 repositories successfully
  - Added 4,252 lines of production code to main
- Tested Claude CLI integration in YOLO containers with 1Password
- Created GitHub issue #37 for OAuth token expiration handling
- Organized and committed all work to `patina` branch:
  - System architecture documentation
  - Neuro-symbolic AI POC (Scryer Prolog + facts)
  - 6 session files from Oct 7-10

**Key Decisions:**
- YOLO command merged to main after thorough testing - ready for production use
- Documentation approach: exhaustive analysis of sessions + code to create canonical reference
- OAuth expiration issue documented carefully without exposing credentials
- All experimental work kept on `patina` branch, separate from main

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- CI failures on PR #36: Fixed formatting with cargo fmt, resolved 5 clippy warnings
- OAuth token expiration in containers: Created issue for graceful handling, proposed detection/fallback solutions
- Documentation accuracy: Deep-dived into code to verify all claims, fixed inaccuracies (YOLO status, DB schema names)

**Patterns Observed:**
- Git as memory system: Session tags enable pattern survival queries
- Architectural pivots: DuckDB→SQLite, Dagger removal - pragmatic simplification
- Neuro-symbolic approach: LLM for extraction + Prolog for inference = powerful combination
- CI discipline: Always run pre-push checks locally to avoid PR failures
