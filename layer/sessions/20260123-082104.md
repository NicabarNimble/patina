## Previous Session Context
Last session explored "anti-slop" challenges in open source and reframed it as "signal over noise" - recognizing that linkage between artifacts (spec→session→commit→code) is the real signal. Audited existing codebase: confirmed `find_session_for_commit()` provides timestamp-based session provenance, but spec→code mapping is missing. Created exploration spec in `layer/surface/build/explore/anti-slop/` with SPEC.md and design.md. Captured `signal-over-noise` belief (confidence 0.82). Updated build.md with E3 completion status.

## Goals
- [ ] release and release-plz fix
- [x] Create spec for release-plz fix in new folder/SPEC.md format

- Last commit: docs: archive session 20260123-050814

**Work Completed:**
1. **Reframed release-plz to "go-public"** - The real goal isn't just fixing release-plz, it's preparing Patina for open source contributions
2. **Created comprehensive go-public spec** - `layer/surface/build/feat/go-public/SPEC.md` (541 lines)
3. **Designed quality gate system for slop era:**
   - Branch flow: patina → main staging layer
   - Contributor verification: register/verify with hash system
   - Patina-signed PRs: all PRs created via `patina pr create`, signature embedded
   - Iterative workflow: `patina pr push` for updates (re-signs)
   - 8 defense layers from registration to release
4. **Grounded spec in reality** - Added EXISTS vs TO BUILD audit
5. **Integrated with existing forge abstraction** - PR commands extend ForgeWriter, use `gh` CLI

**Key Decisions:**
- Trust ladder model: new → proven → maintainer
- Patina as contribution interface (friction is feature)
- Contributor continuity: only original author can push to PR
- Surgical CI: test, clippy, fmt only - no bloat

**Commits:**
- `fd6348bf` spec(feat): add go-public spec for open source launch
- `283c952b` docs: archive session 20260123-050814 (signal-over-noise exploration)

**Patterns Observed:**
- Zooming out from tactical (release-plz fix) to strategic (go-public) clarifies real goals
- Reality check sections ground specs in what actually exists
- Iterative spec refinement through conversation captures nuanced design
