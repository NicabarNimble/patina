## Previous Session Context
Previous session conducted peer review of "new-dawn" architectural documents proposing event-sourced neuro-symbolic system. Created comprehensive 78-page statement of work identifying that documents were technically sound but repeated premature optimization pattern. Key decision: propose validation-first approach (Phase 0, 3-5 hours) to test retrieval hypothesis before committing to 5-week build. Broke work into 9 modular topics enabling independent discussion.

### 06:42 - Update (covering since 07:09)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        2
- Files changed: 1 (analysis-patina-current-truth-and-vision.md)
- Last commit: just now

**Work Completed:**

1. **Technical Truth Assessment** (Commit cffdaeb)
   - Deep code inspection comparing document claims against actual Rust codebase
   - Verified all architectural claims (Scryer Prolog, ONNX, USearch) - accurate
   - Found critical data gaps: observations.db empty (0 bytes, not 463 observations)
   - Documented test count discrepancy (14 tests, not 94 - off by 5x)
   - Identified non-existent commands (patina scrape sessions/git don't exist)
   - Added comprehensive "Technical Truth Assessment" section with:
     - Truth table showing claim vs reality for each module
     - Actionable fix list (code fixes vs doc fixes)
     - Validation commands for future audits
   - Result: Document now clearly separates what exists vs what's designed vs what's missing

2. **Complete CLI Command Audit** (Commit dc118b4)
   - Audited all 12 patina commands one-by-one against implementation
   - Added 5 missing commands: upgrade, build, test, ask, version
   - Documented all flags with accurate defaults:
     - init: Required --llm, optional --dev/--force/--local
     - query semantic: --min-score (0.35), --limit (10)
     - belief validate: --min-score (0.50), --limit (20)
     - doctor: --json, --repos, --update
     - scrape code: --init, --query, --repo, --force
     - embeddings: Added status subcommand
     - yolo: All 5 flags documented
   - Maintained honesty: upgrade is "placeholder", test is "Rust only", docs/pdf are "stubs"

**Key Decisions:**

- **Truth first approach**: Started with comprehensive truth assessment before any fixes
- **100% honesty requirement**: User demanded commands be documented exactly as implemented
- **One command at a time**: User insisted on auditing each command individually (not batched)
- **Default values matter**: Added all default values (not just flag names)

**Challenges Faced:**

- Initial document had significant inaccuracies (463 observations vs 0, 94 tests vs 14)
- Several commands completely missing (build, test, ask, version, upgrade)
- Had to resist urge to batch - user wanted one-by-one verification
- Tracking all flag variations and defaults across 12 commands + subcommands

**Patterns Observed:**

- Codebase architecture is solid (neuro-symbolic + embeddings working)
- Main gap is data pipeline (extraction from sessions/git unimplemented)
- CLI is more feature-complete than document suggested
- Honest documentation > polished marketing (user values truth)
- Validation-first methodology extends to documentation (verify before claiming)
