**LLM**: claude
**Git Branch**: patina
**Session Tag**: session-20251203-184119-start
**Starting Commit**: 77ce4ff4c93f1b12a32b7e13d21c7bdc1a342d10

## Previous Session Context
Previous session designed and implemented Phase 1 of the Mothership daemon: selected **rouille** (blocking HTTP server avoiding async), created `patina serve` subcommand with `/health` and `/version` endpoints on port 50051, and updated README to fix outdated commands. Key architectural decision was HTTP REST over gRPC for simplicity and curl-friendliness. Changes are currently uncommitted (8 files modified).

## Goals
- [x] Commit the Mothership daemon work from previous session
- [x] Review and stage changes appropriately

**Work Completed:**

1. **Surgical Git Commits** - "Scalpel not shotgun" approach

   - `7885441d` feat(serve): Mothership daemon with rouille HTTP
   - `aa3d55e0` docs(build): Phase 3f specification
   - `6028592b` docs(readme): refresh to current architecture
   - `964f63a2` docs(sessions): archive previous session

2. **CI/Pre-push Checks**
   - All 136 tests pass
   - cargo fmt clean
   - cargo clippy clean

3. **PR #48 Created and Merged**
   - Phase 3 Hackathon MVP complete
   - Merged patina → main
   - Synced main locally after merge

**Key Decisions:**
- Separate commits by logical change (style, feat, docs)
- No AI attribution in commits per CLAUDE.md

**Patterns Observed:**
- "Scalpel not shotgun" - commit discipline pays off for clean history
