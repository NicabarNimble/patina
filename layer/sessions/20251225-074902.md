## Previous Session Context
Previous session completed the secrets v2 implementation with 12 commits across 25 files. Major accomplishments: committed 1900+ lines of previously uncommitted code in 8 logical chunks, fixed critical bug where init_vault was overwriting identity when creating second vault (now reuses existing identity), wired up dead code (get_recipient, has_identity, delete_identity, registry.list), added --reset flag and enhanced status display. Tested full flow on Mac Studio with password auth. Key pattern: spec-secrets-v2.md served as "bible" to keep implementation aligned.

## Goals
- [x] Audit sessions system - compare captured vs actual work
- [x] Clean up orphaned session tags
- [x] Fix release-plz CI action

### 07:49-15:18 - Sessions Audit & Cleanup

**Work Completed:**
- Audited 17 session files (Dec 20-24) against 73 git commits
- Anchored analysis in layer/core values (session-capture.md, unix-philosophy.md, dependable-rust.md)
- Found capture rate ~88% - most sessions well-documented
- Identified 2 orphaned session tags from August:
  - `session-20250819-105124` - had content, missing end tag → added end tag
  - `session-20250819-155119` - ghost tag (no session file) → deleted
- Pushed tag cleanup to origin
- Discovered release-plz fix was on patina but not merged to main
- Created PR #66, merged, synced local main

**Key Findings:**
1. Session system is working better than suspected - content IS being captured
2. "Empty" sessions were exploration sessions with discussion but no code changes
3. Real gap is work-commit timing mismatch (work done in one session, committed in next)
4. Context drops leave incomplete sessions but content survives in git

**Key Decisions:**
1. Close orphan with content (add end tag retroactively)
2. Delete ghost tag (tag with no session file)
3. Accept 88% capture rate as healthy - git is always source of truth

**Patterns Observed:**
- Session tags provide audit trail even when files are incomplete
- Git archaeology (comparing tags vs files vs commits) reveals system health
- "Friction-free capture" from session-capture.md is working - the gaps are context drops, not process failures
