## Previous Session Context
Last session (repo-org-namespace) implemented the org/repo namespace structure for the repository registry. Phase 1 changed `add_repo()` to use `org/repo` format as the registry key with proper directory structure. Phase 2 migrated 15 existing repos using a generated script. Phase 3 verified collision fix works (`urfave/cli` and `google-gemini/gemini-cli` coexist). Key insight: SQLite stores relative paths so moving directories is safe. Changes in `internal.rs` and `mod.rs` remain uncommitted.

## Goals
- [ ] Explore skills architecture and design
- [ ] Understand current skill implementation patterns

### 08:08 - Note [patina@19fd4238]
Skills are organized prompt engineering: Structured Context + Tools + Trigger. They work via progressive disclosure, explicit routing (description field), and instruction following - not model magic. Key insight: skills should be thin wrappers calling Patina CLI, keeping Patina valuable independent of any adapter.
