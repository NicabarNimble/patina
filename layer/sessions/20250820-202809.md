## Previous Session Context
Last session explored the strategic direction of Patina, focusing on pattern evolution and documentation structure. The session was classified as pattern-work and helped clarify the project's approach to knowledge accumulation and transfer between projects.

## Goals
- [x] Remove old /session-* commands
- [x] Keep only /session-git-* commands
- [x] Update all references in codebase
- [x] Test that everything still works

## Activity Log

### 20:45 - Major Refactoring
- Removed old session commands from Claude adapter
- Updated session_scripts.rs to only include git versions
- Updated context generation
- Created placeholder files for backward compatibility
- Successfully tested new binary

### 21:11 - Update (covering since session start)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 14
- Last commit: 66 minutes ago

**Work completed:**
- Successfully unified session commands by replacing old session-* with Git-aware versions
- Removed all session-git-* files (8 files deleted)
- Updated Rust code to remove all session-git references
- Maintained backward compatibility by keeping session-* command names
- Added /launch command to the list of available commands
- Tested the changes with patina init

**Key decisions:**
- Instead of removing old commands entirely, replaced their content with Git-aware versions
- Kept command names unchanged to avoid breaking existing workflows
- Decided to make Git integration the default rather than optional

**Challenges faced:**
- Initial approach was too aggressive (tried to remove commands entirely which broke compilation)
- Had to use git reset to rewind after creating unintended files during testing
- Realized the include_str! macros require the files to exist at compile time

**Patterns observed:**
- Simpler is better - unifying commands reduces cognitive load
- Git integration should be the default in modern development workflows
- Breaking changes should be avoided when possible through smart replacement strategies
