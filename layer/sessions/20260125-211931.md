## Previous Session Context
Last session ("clawdbot") conducted a deep-dive comparison of Patina vs Clawdbot architectures. Key accomplishments: re-added clawdbot as a reference repo, created a detailed comparison report (`layer/surface/explore/clawdbot-patterns/research.md`), and established a new spec folder with 4 patterns to test (multi-agent safety, workflow runbooks, SKILL.md frontmatter, learnings in skills). Identified that SKILL.md frontmatter can proceed based on agentskills.io validation, while other patterns need opportunistic testing with measurable rejection criteria. No beliefs captured during that session.

## Goals
- [x] Review Patina project state vs active specs
- [x] Assess what's been built vs what's planned
- [x] Identify gaps and priorities

### 21:54 - Update (covering since 21:19)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 0
- Files changed: 3
- Last commit: 2 hours ago

**Work Completed:**
- Comprehensive "state of the nation" review of Patina
- Deep dive into `patina --help`, specs, git history, sessions
- Analyzed go-public spec blockers and dependencies
- Restructured go-public into 3 phases:
  - Phase 1: Foundation (`patina version` command + GitHub config)
  - Phase 2: Quality Gates (contributor system, PR signing) - deferred
  - Phase 3: Launch (docs, secrets audit, flip public)
- Created CONTRIBUTING.md with trust model, session transparency, quality bar
- Fixed README.md version (v0.1.0 → v0.8.1)

**Discussion Context:**
- Reviewed all 20 CLI commands, 49 archived specs, 25 beliefs
- Identified go-public as the key blocker to open source launch
- Debated minimal vs full quality gates before going public
- User pushed back on "minimal viable docs" - docs should reflect vision, not just checklist

**Key Decisions:**
- Phase 1+2 are solid "do now" items (version command, GitHub config)
- Phase 3+4 (contributor/PR signing) can come after launch
- CONTRIBUTING.md should reflect the trust model vision, not just PR instructions
- README is good, just needed version fix

**Patterns Observed:**
- "Docs should reflect goals with reality driving toward them" - not minimal viable paperwork
- Phased approach: foundation → gates → launch makes dependencies clear
