## Previous Session Context
Last session (20260112-133142) performed deep codebase review of spec-init-hardening.md against actual implementation. Major finding: spec was framed as greenfield but ~80% of infrastructure already exists. Reorganized spec with "Goals", "What Exists Today", "What We Need to Build" sections. Key decision: kept `adapter` terminology (already implemented, matches `LLMAdapter` trait) instead of renaming to `frontend`. Updated config references from `[frontends]` to `[adapters]`. No commits made - was exploration/review session.

## Goals
- [ ] Continue spec-init-hardening review and design
- [ ] Review updated spec organization and validate against codebase
- [ ] Identify any remaining gaps or implementation details needed

### 16:12 - Update (covering since 15:44)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        1
- Files changed: 2
- Last commit: 63 seconds ago

**Work Completed:**
- Deep dive into codebase to verify spec claims (init, adapter, launcher, config)
- Read and analyzed 8 key source files with exact line numbers
- Created comprehensive "Code Review Findings" section in spec with:
  - Exact file paths and line numbers for all changes
  - Tables showing what to DELETE, ADD, KEEP
  - Config schema clarification (`[frontends]` vs `[adapters]`)
  - "Minimal Implementation Path" checklist
- Added "Quick Start for New Sessions" section at top of spec
- Rewrote Implementation Phases with step-by-step instructions and code snippets
- Updated Files to Modify section with line number references
- Committed: `ba967713`

**Key Decisions:**
1. Keep `adapter default` (not `switch`) - already implemented, no benefit to rename
2. Defer `[frontends]` → `[adapters]` config rename to separate PR - avoids scope creep
3. Mark Phase 4 (Observability/events.db) as optional - core works without it
4. MCP config strategy: best-effort in `adapter add`, auto-fixed silently in launcher

**Patterns Observed:**
- Spec was accurate about 80% existing, but lacked precision for implementation
- Adding exact line numbers transforms spec from "design doc" to "implementation guide"
- "Quick Start" section at top helps fresh sessions orient immediately
- Separating "what exists" vs "what to change" reduces cognitive load

**Session Goal:** Make spec executable by a fresh session without additional exploration.
