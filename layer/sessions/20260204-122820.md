## Previous Session Context
Completed nearly all of D0 (mother-delivery) in one session: unified CLI/MCP/serve to all use QueryEngine as the single search pipeline, removed `--hybrid`/`--lexical`/`--dimension` CLI flags, added `--legacy` escape hatch, and simplified serve daemon to a 3-liner. Net result was -99 lines across 5 files with 8/9 D0 exit criteria checked. Remaining: `patina eval` benchmark verification (eval command is legacy, needs updating to test QueryEngine output). Also captured two beliefs: `bridges-become-permanent` and `spec-challenge-traceback`.

## Goals
- [ ] continue D0 work - eval update and D1
