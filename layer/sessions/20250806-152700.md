## Previous Session Context
The previous session focused on building new upgrade and doctor commands, simplifying the command structure, and implementing feature flags for dev commands. Key achievements included creating a Dev subcommand structure with multiple development tools, updating the command-structure-redesign.md to reflect the actual implementation status, and identifying that the update command serves users rather than Patina developers. The session revealed that init lacks critical --refresh functionality and many dev commands are still skeleton implementations.
