## Previous Session Context
Discovered significant behavioral differences between original and refactored scrape module - refactored version extracts 58% more functions and generates 11x more call graph relations. Fixed 6 critical bugs including database initialization, fingerprint storage, and SQL injection vulnerabilities. Created documentation acknowledging that feature parity was achieved but not behavioral parity.

## Goals
- [ ] Review refactor implementation and understand behavioral differences
- [ ] Analyze why refactored version extracts more data
- [ ] Determine if increased extraction is a bug or improvement
