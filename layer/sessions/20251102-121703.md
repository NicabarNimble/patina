## Previous Session Context
Previous session explored Turso integration strategy. After critical peer review analysis, abandoned "sync wrapper over async" approach and pivoted to **dual API strategy**: separate sync (SQLite) and async (Turso) implementations via mutually exclusive feature flags. Design document `database-abstraction-turso-integration.md` was completely rewritten to reflect this architectural direction, using each backend as designed rather than fighting the ecosystem.

### 17:10 - Update (covering since 12:17)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        1
- Files changed: 2
- Last commit: 60 seconds ago

**Work completed:**
- Reviewed 5 session files to understand dual API pivot evolution (Oct 31 → Nov 2)
- Read full database-abstraction-turso-integration.md design document (1091 lines)
- Identified 6 major ambiguities: redundant enum warnings, status confusion, answered questions in "Open Questions", over-detailed checklists, verbose code examples, unclear scrape/code pattern status
- Streamlined design document from 1091 to 535 lines (51% reduction, 556 lines removed)
- Updated metadata: status from "active" to "design", version 6→7
- Committed: `4a8c625` docs: streamline database abstraction design document (51% reduction)

**Key decisions:**
- **Single prominent status section** - Replaced 3 redundant enum warnings with one clear statement at top
- **Removed "Open Questions"** - Questions were already answered within the document (mutually exclusive features, vector syntax handled per-backend, turso as default)
- **Condensed project management details** - Removed detailed effort estimates (12-17 days), verbose checklists, and duplicate status sections
- **Focused on architecture** - Keep design doc centered on *why/what* decisions, not *how much/when* project management
- **Preserved all technical decisions** - 51% reduction without losing essential architectural guidance

**Challenges faced:**
- **Balancing reduction vs completeness** - Had to identify which verbose sections were reference material (keep condensed version) vs redundant explanations (remove entirely)
- **Clarifying scrape/code pattern** - Tricky to explain it's both the "north star pattern" AND currently using technical debt (DatabaseBackend enum) - resolved by focusing on pattern principles, not current state
- **Code example reduction** - Kept critical dual API demonstrations, removed verbose implementation details that can be inferred

**Patterns observed:**
- **Documentation debt compounds** - Design doc accumulated multiple status warnings and redundant sections over 3 sessions (Nov 1-2) as architecture evolved - single cleanup pass removed confusion
- **Session review valuable** - Reading 5 consecutive sessions revealed clear narrative arc: exploration → wrapper approach → critical review → pivot to dual API
- **"Open questions already answered"** - Anti-pattern where sections ask questions that later sections resolve - should be removed or moved to decision records
- **Project management ≠ architecture design** - Effort estimates, detailed checklists, granular success criteria belong in tracking docs, not architectural decision records
- **51% reduction felt right** - Document now navigable in single read, all essential decisions preserved, no information loss
