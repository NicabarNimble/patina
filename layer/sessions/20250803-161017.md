# Session: git
**ID**: 20250803-161017
**Started**: 2025-08-03T20:10:17Z
**LLM**: claude

## Previous Session Context
The previous session focused on testing the enhanced session management system. The session explored timestamps, context tracking, and the integration between Claude's session commands and Patina's knowledge management system. Key work included testing session-update functionality and verifying the time-span tracking feature.

## Goals
- [ ] git

## Activity Log
### 16:10 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: git


### 17:13 - Update (covering since 16:10)

**Work completed:**
- Successfully built Phase 1 of git-aware navigation system
- Created comprehensive indexer module with git state tracking
- Implemented NavigationMap with in-memory cache for fast queries
- Built GitNavigationStateMachine to process git events
- Created workspace monitor with file watching capabilities
- Fixed all compilation errors - code now builds successfully

**Key decisions:**
- Memory-first architecture for sub-second navigation performance
- Git states directly map to confidence levels (Experimental → Low → Medium → High → Verified)
- Event-driven updates from workspace changes
- Clean separation between navigation cache and state machine
- Used Arc<RwLock> for shared state between components

**Challenges faced:**
- Rust borrow checker issues with async locks - solved by scoping lock guards
- Import path confusion - fixed by understanding module structure
- GitStatus field name mismatch - resolved by checking actual type definition

**Patterns observed:**
- The three-layer architecture (Core/Surface/Dust) maps well to git states
- Workspace isolation pattern from container-use provides perfect foundation
- Session commands could trigger indexing for real-time pattern discovery

### 17:17 - Update (covering since 17:13)

**Final tasks:**
- Updated git-aware-navigation-design.md with implementation status
- Added comprehensive TODO list for next session
- Listed all key reference documents for context
- Prepared clear instructions for Phase 2 continuation

**Key insight:**
The git state machine acts as a confidence modifier for navigation results, making the system aware of pattern maturity through the natural git workflow.
