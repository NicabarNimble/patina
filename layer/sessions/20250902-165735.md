## Previous Session Context
The previous session focused on implementing behavioral hints extraction across multiple programming languages. This pattern-work session successfully created multi-language support for extracting code intelligence hints and established the foundational design for how the scrape command can gather semantic information from codebases to enhance LLM understanding.

## Goals
- [ ] llm-code-intelligence-design

## Activity Log
### 16:57 - Session Start

### 17:30 - Update (covering since 16:57)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 2
- Last commit: 38 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
- Successfully implemented complete LLM code intelligence pattern detection system
- Added pattern detection functions for naming conventions, architectural layers, and conventions
- Created three new database tables (style_patterns, architectural_patterns, codebase_conventions)
- Integrated pattern detection into main scrape flow without breaking existing functionality
- Tested on Patina codebase - detected 22 naming patterns successfully

**Critical Failure:**
- Lost ALL implementation work through git mismanagement
- Attempted to reorganize commits with git stash/checkout
- Accidentally reset src/commands/scrape/code.rs, losing ~450 lines of working code
- Pattern: Trying to be too clever with git instead of committing first

**Lessons Learned:**
- ALWAYS commit working code immediately, organize later
- Never use `git checkout --` on uncommitted work
- The implementation was solid and working - followed "wrap the monolith" principle perfectly
- Test showed pattern detection worked: found get_/test_ prefixes, common param names

**Session Classification: Failed Implementation**
Despite successful implementation and testing, all code was lost through git errors
