## Previous Session Context
The previous session (20250728-182427) was the inaugural test of Patina's new hook-based session system. Key accomplishments included:
- Successfully tested all session commands (/session-start, /session-update, /session-note, /session-end)
- Verified git integration captures branch state and changes
- Identified that git tracking helps understand code evolution during sessions
- Discovered time span marking creates clear context windows for AI
- Session files properly created in `.claude/context/sessions/`

## Goals
- [ ] Review all session command implementations for correctness
- [ ] Clean up any temporary test artifacts or debug code
- [ ] Ensure session scripts are production-ready
- [ ] Verify proper error handling in all session commands
- [ ] Document the final session workflow for users

## Activity Log
### 18:42 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: session commands final review and clean up


### 18:51 - Update (covering since 18:42)

**Context transfer issues discovered:**
- Every new session feels like "memento" - no memory retention
- Session capture with agent is too slow (long waits for each command)
- Need to rethink the session architecture

**Work completed during this period:**
- Started session for final review of session commands
- Created 8 todos for systematic review
- Reviewed all four session scripts (session-start.sh, session-update.sh, session-note.sh, session-end.sh)
- Identified source of confusion: resources/claude/ contains templates, .claude/ is production location
- All scripts have good error handling and proper functionality
- Discovered the real issue: context transfer between sessions is broken
- User decided to live with current implementation and gather real usage data

**Key insight:**
The session system works mechanically but fails at its core purpose - accumulating context over time. Each session is an island.

### 19:06 - Session End (covering since 18:51)

**Final activities and conclusions:**
- Completed review of all session commands - they are functionally correct
- Accepted the fundamental limitation: sessions don't transfer context effectively
- Made peace with the "memento" problem - each session starts fresh
- Decided to gather real-world usage data before attempting fixes
- Acknowledged that the mechanical parts work but the vision isn't realized

**Session system status:**
- Commands: Working correctly in .claude/bin/
- Git integration: Captures state properly
- File creation: Sessions saved in correct locations
- Error handling: Adequate for production use
- Context transfer: Non-functional (known limitation)

**Decision made:**
Rather than continuing to iterate on a broken concept, the user chose to:
1. Use the current implementation as-is
2. Gather actual usage patterns and pain points
3. Let the system "develop patina" through real use
4. Revisit the architecture with concrete data

**Final observation:**
The irony isn't lost - a tool named Patina that's meant to accumulate wisdom over time currently forgets everything between sessions. This gap between vision and implementation will guide future development.
