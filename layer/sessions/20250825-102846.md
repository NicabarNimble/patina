**Starting Commit**: 473895d40bf7688ddd57bfac2f734c94becb535f

## Previous Session Context
Completed Phase 2 of the stable-parsing-engine, implementing call graph extraction with 5,368 call relationships identified across the codebase. The system now has both documentation extraction (Phase 1) and call graph analysis (Phase 2) working together in DuckDB, enabling powerful context retrieval with recursive CTEs for complete call chain discovery.

## Goals
- [ ] stable-parsing-engine

### 10:33 - Update (covering since 10:28)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 4
- Last commit: 2 hours ago

**Work completed:**
- Reviewed stable-parsing-engine documentation and implementation status
- Examined Phase 1 (documentation extraction) and Phase 2 (call graph) completion
- Analyzed git history showing successful implementation of both phases
- Confirmed 259 docs extracted, 5,368 call relationships mapped
- Verified 100x token reduction achieved vs raw file reading

**Key decisions:**
- Session was brief - mainly reviewing completed work
- No new implementation needed as Phase 1 and 2 are complete
- Ready to proceed to Phase 3 (Context Retrieval Engine) in next session

**Technical details:**
- DuckDB arrays working well for keyword search
- Recursive CTEs enable graph traversal for context expansion
- Both phases delivering immediate value independently
