## Previous Session Context
Completed E2 testing by creating 5 beliefs via the epistemic-beliefs skill and validating auto-triggering behavior. Key insight emerged: E3 isn't about indexing belief files for search, but about **beliefs as OUTPUT** - synthesized from scry/assay queries and linked back to evidence (sessions, commits, code). Confirmed that scry (semantic) + assay (structural) complement each other: scry finds "why we decided X" while assay proves "code reflects X". Multiple belief creation paths (manual E2, organic E4, query-driven E3) all converge on evidence-grounded beliefs.

## Goals
- [ ] Explore beliefs as evidence - how beliefs link to and emerge from evidence
