## Previous Session Context
The previous Dagger session focused on implementing Go workspace service design for Patina. Key activities included designing the workspace client architecture and creating a workspace service that runs Go-based Dagger containers for build operations.

## Goals
- [ ] document

## Activity Log
### 11:00 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: document


### 12:01 - Update (covering since 11:00)

**Work completed**:
- Successfully reorganized entire layer/ documentation structure into domain-based topics
- Added YAML frontmatter to all markdown files preserving original creation dates
- Merged PR #3 (layer reorganization) to main
- Fixed PR #2 (go-dagger-workspace) formatting issues and updated CI to test Go code
- Added conditional Go testing to GitHub Actions workflow

**Key decisions**:
- Keep layer/ at project root (not in domain subdirectories)
- Organize by domains: dagger, sessions, testing, architecture, patina, etc.
- Test Go workspace code in CI when present (optional Dagger feature)
- Add YAML frontmatter for future database migration

**Challenges faced**:
- PR #2 failing due to cargo fmt issues - fixed by running formatter
- Clippy warnings about format strings - added to todo for next session
- Managing git stash/branches with multiple changes - handled carefully
- Workspace directory from other branch appearing - left untracked

**Patterns observed**:
- Domain-based organization makes documentation much clearer
- GitHub Actions needs updating when adding new languages (Go)
- Clippy enforces newer Rust idioms (inline format variables)
- Layer reorganization was smooth with proper scripts and careful git management
