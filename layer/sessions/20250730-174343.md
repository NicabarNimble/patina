**LLM**: claude

## Previous Session Context
The previous session focused on refactoring the workspace command to "agent" for clarity, fixing CI issues with cargo formatting, and documenting repository workflows. Successfully merged PR #4 after resolving formatting issues and creating pre-push checks to prevent future CI failures.

## Goals
- [ ] refactor

## Activity Log
### 17:43 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: refactor


### 19:21 - Update (covering since 17:43)

**Work completed:**
- Successfully removed dead commands (add, commit, push) from codebase
- Cleaned up unused yolo.rs experimental code
- Updated CLAUDE.md and removed obsolete brain redirect file
- Merged PR #5 for dead command refactoring
- Deep dive into layer documentation revealed knowledge management challenges
- Created knowledge-oxidation.md pattern for managing layer decay
- Merged PR #6 for knowledge oxidation documentation

**Key decisions:**
- Feature flags not needed for current Patina challenges
- Real problem is "layer decay" - accumulating outdated knowledge
- Introduced "knowledge oxidation" metaphor - some protects, some obscures
- Need "scraping" tools to consolidate and extract patterns
- Each Patina project is its own domain with specific wisdom

**Challenges faced:**
- Context explosion in layer documentation
- Multiple overlapping patterns about similar concepts
- No clear way to deprecate outdated knowledge
- Realizing Patina needs to solve its own core problem

**Patterns observed:**
- Knowledge naturally oxidizes over time
- Consolidation needed for similar patterns
- Session extraction should be automated
- Metadata (YAML frontmatter) enables intelligent processing
- Domain-specific layers are more valuable than universal knowledge
