## Previous Session Context
The last session focused on continuing SQLite automerge refactor work, building on the git-aware navigation system with rqlite persistence. This session appears to have involved ongoing implementation of the navigation state system with database-backed persistence.

## Goals
- [ ] git-aware-navigation-design-sqlite.md use as source of truth to update git-aware-navigation-design.md

## Activity Log
### 19:48 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: git-aware-navigation-design-sqlite.md use as source of truth to update git-aware-navigation-design.md


### 22:07 - Update (covering since 19:48)

**Work Completed:**
- Successfully merged all unique content from `git-aware-navigation-design-sqlite.md` into `git-aware-navigation-design.md`
- Added implementation details: HybridDatabase, Automerge CRDT, synchronous examples
- Added "The Async Trap" and "The Realization" sections explaining the architectural shift
- Added implementation notes, challenges encountered, and core design principles
- Deep dive on codebase to verify what's actually implemented vs documented
- Moved `git-aware-navigation-design-sqlite.md` to dust/ layer with proper archival metadata

**Key Decisions:**
- Keep `git-aware-navigation-design.md` as single source of truth
- Archive SQLite doc rather than delete (escape hatch philosophy)
- Preserve all implementation learnings and challenges in merged doc

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Initial confusion about architecture changes → Deep code analysis clarified actual state
- Understanding git workflow integration → Identified 3 layers working together
- Document merge complexity → Careful section-by-section merge preserving all info

**Patterns Observed:**
- Escape hatch philosophy in action: SQLite doc preserved in dust/
- Documentation evolution: separate experimental doc → merged final design
- Synchronous architecture genuinely simpler than async for local operations

### 22:10 - Update (covering since 22:07)
Brief discussion about session-capture agent and unified-context-system.md design
