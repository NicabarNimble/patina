# Session: layer

## Previous Session Context
Last session focused on setting up the new layer folder structure with a deep exploration of knowledge oxidation patterns. Key accomplishments included designing a hybrid human-readable markdown approach with code verification and developing a phased semantic search strategy for pattern discovery. The session identified next steps: reorganizing core/ with executable proofs and question-based naming, moving sessions to surface/raw/, and building tag-based search infrastructure.

## Goals
- [ ] Design layer folder structure based on knowledge oxidation pattern

## Activity Log
### 07:51 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: layer


### 11:30 - Update (covering since 07:51)

**Work completed:**
- Deep analysis of brain → layer evolution in Patina
- Explored semantic organization challenges (clustering, cross-refs, summaries, tags)
- Found we'd already discussed all these concepts extensively in past sessions
- Applied Spotify/Stripe model to core docs transformation
- Created 11 atomic, verifiable core docs with executable verification
- Established naming convention (noun-based, not questions)
- Implemented metadata schema with verification blocks
- Archived old generic docs to dust/archived-core-docs/
- Designed comprehensive indexer as navigation system (not search)
- Created indexer-design.md v2 with memory cache + rqlite architecture

**Key decisions:**
- Core docs must have executable verification (confidence = verified, not high/medium/low)
- Indexer is navigation system telling LLMs where knowledge lives
- Dust isn't failures - it's valuable wisdom not currently implemented
- Memory cache + rqlite for fast queries with persistence
- Start with both memory and DB from beginning, not migrate later
- Indexer enriches markdown with discovered relationships

**Challenges faced:**
- Initial confusion about Python prototype (Patina is pure Rust!)
- Naming conventions felt clunky with questions
- Understanding indexer purpose (navigation, not content search)
- Clarifying memory vs rqlite roles (both needed)

**Patterns observed:**
- Atomic docs with verification enable trust
- LLMs need navigation more than search
- Knowledge has lifecycle (surface → core/dust)
- Self-indexing by LLMs solves semantic problem
- Executable documentation (Stripe-style) keeps docs honest
