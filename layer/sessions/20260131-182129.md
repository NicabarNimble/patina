## Previous Session Context
Completed E4 steps 1-4: rewrote E4 spec to replace "Extraction Automation" with "Computed Belief Metrics (Use & Truth)", built belief scraper cross-referencing (43 beliefs × 550 sessions), added `patina belief audit` command with use/truth metrics, deprecated fake confidence scores from `create-belief`, and fixed evidence verification (39% → 79% by recognizing bare session references and file paths). Captured belief `measure-the-measurement`. Remaining work: E4 steps 5-7 (file migration, MCP context) to complete v0.10.0 milestone.

## Goals
- [ ] Computed Belief Metrics (Use & Truth)

## Activity Log
### 18:21 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: Computed Belief Metrics (Use & Truth)
Working on branch: patina

### 20:24 - Update (covering since 18:21)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 4
- Files changed: 14
- Last commit: 80 minutes ago

**Work completed:**
- Investigated why evidence verification was 63/80 (79%) not 80/80 — user pushed back on accepting the gap
- Categorized all 17 unverified evidence lines: 8 missing wikilinks, 2 commit refs verifier couldn't handle, 7 narrative reasoning with no session link
- Key insight from user: "the session gives more reason to the belief" — every piece of evidence was articulated in a session, so every line should cite that session
- Backfilled session provenance on 13 belief files (17 lines) by tracing `git log` and `git tag --contains` to find origin sessions
- Fixed evidence verifier: added `git rev-parse` for `[[commit-HASH]]` refs, fuzzy matching for truncated session IDs like `[[session-20260105]]`
- Updated `create-belief.sh` to auto-read active session ID and prepend `[[session-{id}]]:` to every evidence line
- Updated E4 spec: expanded from 7 to 10 build steps, new exit criteria for 100% verification
- Result: 81/81 evidence verified (100%)
- Deep-dived top 5 beliefs (measure-first, spec-first, sync-first, eventlog-is-truth, session-git-integration) through scry and assay — found all have session provenance but zero structural code evidence
- Discovered 3 orphaned rules from E0 (not scraped, not indexed, stale fake confidence) — discussed whether rules should be absorbed into beliefs

**Key decisions:**
1. "Evidence traced" vs "evidence verified" — current metric measures link resolution, not claim truth. Honest about what 100% means.
2. Every evidence line must have session provenance — the conversation where reasoning happened IS the source
3. Prevention > backfill — create-belief.sh now auto-attaches session ID so future beliefs can't have orphaned evidence
4. Rules may be absorbed into beliefs — beliefs already act as actionable directives. Rules add Conditions/Exceptions but beliefs have Attacked-By with scoping. One fewer concept to maintain.
5. Beliefs need structural evidence (code links, assay data) not just session provenance — `grep "async fn" src/` returning 0 is stronger evidence for sync-first than any session quote

**Patterns observed:**
- measure-the-measurement pattern recurred: 79% contradicted reality, fixing the instrument revealed 100% was achievable
- Beliefs are conversation-heavy, code-light — plenty of "we discussed this" evidence, almost no "the code proves this" evidence
- The top 5 beliefs by use have the richest session evidence and the poorest structural evidence — inversely correlated
- Rules are dead documents — created E0, never maintained, not scraped or indexed


### 20:36 - Update (covering since 20:24)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 4 (no new commits — discussion phase)
- Last commit: 2 hours ago

**Discussion completed (no code, all design):**
- Deep-dived top 5 beliefs through scry and assay — found structural evidence that beliefs don't link to:
  - `sync-first`: zero `async fn` in entire src/, serve/mod.rs line 8 says "Design: Blocking HTTP with rouille (no async/tokio)"
  - `eventlog-is-truth`: 10 files, 28 call sites for `insert_event()` — the nervous system of the app
  - `spec-first`: 16 active SPEC.md files, 234 commits reference "spec"
  - `session-git-integration`: 884 git tags, 551 session files, 8 src files handle tags
  - `measure-first`: tests/retrieval/ directory with baseline infrastructure
- Discussed whether rules should be absorbed into beliefs — user pushed back: atomic beliefs have value, rules compose them. Don't blur the line.
- Traced belief portability design back to Mother spec and session-20251119-061119: beliefs are already the designed shareable abstraction between projects via persona layer
- Connected linking work to portability: well-linked beliefs in one project can travel to another. Poorly-linked beliefs are just notes.

**Key decisions:**
1. Keep beliefs atomic — don't add Conditions/Exceptions to beliefs, that's what rules do
2. Rules need to be fixed (scraped, indexed, metrics), not killed
3. Linking is the foundation for belief portability across projects via Mother
4. The two-tier model (project beliefs → persona beliefs) is already designed, linking is what makes beliefs trustworthy enough to promote

**Patterns observed:**
- User's instinct to protect atomic belief format was right — composition belongs in rules, not in bloated beliefs
- The Mother architecture from Nov 2025 already anticipated everything we're discussing — `user BELIEVES belief` is a graph edge type, persona.db holds cross-project beliefs
- Linking isn't cosmetic — it's the trust layer. A belief with sessions + commits + structural code evidence is knowledge. A belief with no links is an opinion.


### 20:50 - Final Update (covering since 20:36)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 4 (no new commits — wrapping up)

**Session wrap-up:**
- No additional code changes. Session closing after design discussion phase.

**Session summary:**
E4 steps 5-7 complete. Evidence verification 63/80 → 81/81 (100%). Verifier handles commit refs and fuzzy session IDs. create-belief.sh auto-attaches session provenance. Deep analysis of top 5 beliefs revealed structural evidence gap — beliefs have session provenance but no code links. Rules identified as dead (3 from E0, not scraped). User decided: keep beliefs atomic, fix rules rather than absorb them, and linking is the foundation for cross-project belief portability via Mother. Next: enrich beliefs with structural evidence, scrape/index rules, continue E4 steps 8-10.
