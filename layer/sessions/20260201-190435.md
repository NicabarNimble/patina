## Previous Session Context
Completed E4.5 Phase 4 (scry lexical fix) and Phase 5 steps 20-21. Aligned `is_lexical_query()` with `is_code_like()` heuristics, added `--lexical` CLI escape hatch, and added `git_tags` (996 tags) and `git_tracked_files` (1492 files) tables to the git scraper. Wrote verification queries for 2 newly unblocked beliefs (`session-git-integration`, `project-config-in-git`), bringing the total to 16/16 passing across 6 beliefs with 0 contested/errors. Key remaining work: scale verification to all 44 beliefs (Phase 6) and complete any remaining Phase 5 steps.

## Goals
- [x] Phase 6, step 24: Add verification queries to remaining structurally testable beliefs
- [x] Phase 6, step 28: Measure coverage (89% >= 80% target)
- [x] Phase 5 steps 22/23: Close with evaluation (deferred — cost/benefit)
- [x] Phase 6 steps 26/27: SKILL.md + schema reference documentation

## Activity Log
### 19:04 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: Continue E4.5 Belief Verification — Phase 6: Scale to Full Belief Coverage + Finish Phase 5
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20260201-190435-claude-start

### 19:04-19:25 — Categorize all 44 beliefs
- Read all 35 unverified belief files, categorized as:
  - 18 structurally testable (can write SQL/assay/temporal queries)
  - 17 process beliefs (testimony is correct evidence — no structural proof)
  - 1 coverage-blocked (ci-gates-not-ci-spam needs CI YAML parsing)
  - 2 borderline process (truthful-specs, specs-source-of-truth)

### 19:25-19:40 — Write and test verification queries
- Tested 30+ queries against live DB with sqlite3
- Wrote `## Verification` sections for 18 beliefs using SQL, assay DSL, and git_tracked_files
- Query patterns: absence checks (expect = 0), existence checks (expect >= N), architecture (assay callers/importers), file tracking (git_tracked_files)
- Built release, installed, ran `patina scrape` — 47 queries across 24 beliefs
- Results: 46 pass, 1 contested (archive-completed-work: 3 completed specs in active dirs), 0 errors

### 19:40-19:50 — Close Phase 5 eval + Phase 6 docs
- Steps 22/23: Evaluated and deferred — YAML parser for 1 belief not justified; markdown checkbox parser not needed when patterns table covers status
- Step 26: Updated SKILL.md with verification query format, types, assay commands, expectation operators, when-not-to-verify guidance
- Step 27: Created `references/verification-schema.md` with all table schemas, columns, event types, and common query patterns
- Updated SPEC: all Phase 6 steps checked off, coverage exit criteria met


### 22:19 - Update (covering since 19:04)
