# Session: hooks
**ID**: 20250802-225700
**Started**: 2025-08-03T02:57:00Z
**LLM**: claude

## Previous Session Context
The last session focused on hooks testing and branch cleanup after successfully implementing hooks auto-installation. Previously fixed hooks configuration by moving from hooks.json to settings.local.json, created resources/claude/hooks/ directory with all hook scripts, and updated the Claude adapter to automatically install hooks during `patina init`. Ended before completing the branch trimming task.

## Goals
- [ ] hooks

## Activity Log

### 23:47 - Update (covering since 22:57)
**Work completed**:
- Successfully ran `/session-start` command to initialize a new hooks-focused session
- Updated the previous session context based on the last session notes about hooks testing and branch cleanup
- Initiated the session update workflow to document current progress

**Key decisions**:
- Started a new session specifically for "hooks challenges" to continue the hooks work from the previous session
- Maintained session continuity by properly summarizing the previous session's accomplishments with hooks auto-installation

**Challenges faced**:
- No significant challenges yet - session initialization went smoothly

**Patterns observed**:
- The session workflow provides excellent continuity between work sessions
- The hooks implementation from the previous session appears to be working as expected
- Clear session boundaries help maintain focused work on specific features

### 23:48 - Update (covering since 23:47)
**Work completed**:
- Prepared to end the session after brief initialization
- Documented the session update process

**Key decisions**:
- Decided to end the session early as it was primarily a test of the hooks workflow
- The session successfully demonstrated the hooks functionality is working

**Challenges faced**:
- None - this was a short session focused on testing the session workflow with hooks

**Patterns observed**:
- The session commands continue to work smoothly
- Short sessions are perfectly valid for testing or quick tasks
