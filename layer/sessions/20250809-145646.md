# Session: Dependable Rust
**ID**: 20250809-145646
**Started**: 2025-08-09T18:56:46Z
**LLM**: claude

## Previous Session Context
The previous session successfully applied the Dependable Rust black-box pattern to all 5 critical modules in Patina, reducing public API surface by over 90%. Key insight: "Modularity comes from small trait surfaces, not small files" - we kept large implementation files when properly hidden behind facades. Patterns were documented in layer/core/ and changes were committed to the dependable-rust branch.

## Goals
- [ ] Dependable Rust

## Activity Log
### 14:56 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: Dependable Rust

### 15:00-16:30 - Repository Cleanup & .gitignore Alignment
**Completed:**
- Deep dive into layer/core documentation to understand Patina's architecture
- Successfully merged Dependable Rust PR after fixing clippy warnings and restoring MCP functionality
- Comprehensive git cleanup: deleted 5 local branches, 8 GitHub branches
- Freed 4GB by running `cargo clean`
- Created branch audit and GitHub cleanup scripts for future use
- Analyzed `patina init` behavior vs .gitignore configuration
- Reorganized workspace: moved reference repos to `layer/dust/repos/`
- Updated .gitignore to properly handle Go artifacts and Patina Dust

**Key Insights:**
- `workspace/` folder is source code for Go/Dagger service (should be in git)
- Reference repos belong in `layer/dust/repos/` (gitignored, personal collection)
- .gitignore needed cleanup: removed non-existent `workspace/target/`, added Go artifacts
- "Modularity comes from small trait surfaces, not small files" - core Patina principle
