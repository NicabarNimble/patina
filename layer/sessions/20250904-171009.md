## Previous Session Context
Last session completed a critical fix for the C parser's stack overflow issue by converting the recursive `extract_c_function_name` function to iterative, successfully testing it on SDL's 84k+ symbols. Also removed unnecessary behavioral_hints and git_metrics tables per the LLM code intelligence design review, and recovered 7 missing session files from .claude/context/sessions. The iterative fix completed the work started on Sept 1 (which was only 90% done) and proved that removing code can expose latent bugs.

### 23:30 - Update (covering since 17:10)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        1
- Files changed: 2
- Last commit: 6 hours ago

**Work Completed:**
- Deep analysis of HumanLayer's knowledge management and documentation staleness handling
- Discovered they use parallel agent orchestration to minimize token usage
- Found their "thoughts" system - separate Git repo for knowledge with hard links for search
- Analyzed their token monitoring (basic session-level tracking, no per-agent metrics)
- Created comprehensive analysis document in layer/surface/humanlayer-knowledge-management-analysis.md

**Key Decisions:**
- HumanLayer doesn't solve staleness - they embrace regeneration over validation
- Their multi-agent pattern is architectural optimization, not measured
- Token savings come from parallel execution and focused agents
- Documentation treated as temporal artifacts with Git context

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- **Challenge**: Understanding if HumanLayer had clever staleness solutions
- **Solution**: Deep dive revealed they accept staleness and optimize for easy regeneration
- **Challenge**: Determining their token optimization approach
- **Solution**: Found it's architectural (parallel agents) not metric-driven

**Patterns Observed:**
- "Always re-research" philosophy beats trying to maintain freshness
- Hard links solve symlink traversal problems for AI tools
- Parallel agent decomposition minimizes context per agent
- Temporal context (Git commits + timestamps) more valuable than freshness validation
