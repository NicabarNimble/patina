## Previous Session Context
Last session made `patina init` idempotent by adding GitHub repo existence checking, graceful cloning of existing repos, and gitignore management. Fixed critical "Name already exists" error by detecting existing GitHub repos and cloning them instead of failing. Also handled existing .git directories gracefully using remote add/set-url operations.

### 14:46 - Update (covering since 11:54)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        6
- Files changed: 0
- Last commit: 2 hours ago

**Work Completed:**
- Reviewed git history and recent layer/sessions to understand development trajectory
- Created PR #38 merging patina branch improvements into main
- Fixed Cairo parser compilation errors for cairo-lang 2.13 API changes
- Resolved CI formatting issues and pushed fixes
- Successfully merged PR #38 with all CI checks passing
- Synced patina branch with main after merge
- Created neuro-symbolic-knowledge-system branch for future work
- Deep dive into historical sessions exploring persona architecture vision
- Reviewed domain-architecture.md and project-as-domain concepts from July/Aug 2025
- Uncovered central persona vision: Scryer Prolog with atomic facts about user preferences, philosophy, work style

**Key Decisions:**
- Decided to pause neuro-symbolic persona work to think through architecture
- Identified need to clarify: persona vs domain knowledge separation, facts.pl vs facts.db canonical source
- Recognized this as foundational architecture decision requiring careful consideration

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Challenge: PR #38 failed CI due to cairo-lang 2.13 API changes
- Solution: Updated all .text() calls to .to_string(&self.db), fixed formatting, verified with local tests
- Challenge: Understanding the cart/horse problem with neuro-symbolic architecture
- Solution: Researched historical sessions, found domain-architecture.md from Aug 2025, clarified vision

**Patterns Observed:**
- Project-as-domain pattern from July/Aug: each project has own facts.db
- Central persona concept: ~/.patina/ with user's preferences/philosophy as Prolog facts
- Scryer Prolog chosen for being Rust-based, aligns with Apple Silicon native stack
- Neuro-symbolic approach: LLM (neural extraction) + Prolog (symbolic reasoning)
- User's emerging vision: thousands of atomic facts defining preferences, linked to research/philosophy
