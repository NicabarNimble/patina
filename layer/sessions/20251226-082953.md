## Previous Session Context
Designed new hosts/deploy architecture for persistent servers - created `layer/surface/build/spec-hosts-deploy.md` (317 lines) defining the Mothership + Projects + Hosts model. Key insight: projects are just projects with capabilities detected from what exists, not typed categories. Also diagnosed scry retrieval issues (min_score=0.0 returning irrelevant results) and secrets SSH injection problems (naive command quoting breaks docker-compose). Decided to let implementation reveal pipeline architecture rather than over-designing upfront.

## Goals
- [ ] review

### 11:17 - Update (covering since 08:29)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 7
- Files changed: 5 files + 1 new spec
- Last commit: 40 seconds ago

**Work Completed:**
- Persona fusion Phase 1: Added `patina persona status` command, `[PERSONA]` source tags in CLI and MCP output
- Updated build.md: Verified secrets v2 complete, added measurement tools section, set quality-gates as current direction
- Created spec-quality-gates.md: Andrew Ng measurement-first approach
- Fixed README command reference: Moved eval/bench from "legacy" to "measurement tools"
- Discovered retrieval regression: MRR 0.624 → 0.448 (needs investigation)

**Key Decisions:**
- Persona fusion Phase 2 (source tagging system) deferred - premature without data showing users need it
- Shifted from feature development to quality measurement - "Don't add features without data"
- Scope direction: Patina = knowledge layer; yolo/hosts-deploy may move to future Mothership project
- eval/bench commands are core measurement infrastructure, not legacy

**Patterns Observed:**
- We built measurement tools (eval, bench) but weren't using them - quality regressed without notice
- The retrieval-queryset.json ground truth exists and works
- 207 tests passing, good baseline but no coverage % tracking

**Next Session:**
- Investigate MRR regression (check ground truth paths, compare scry output)
- Start from checklist in spec-quality-gates.md
