**Starting Commit**: 8c6db87614d4d94dd53a73a1668af7b5cb0ee834

## Previous Session Context
Built a file audit tool (`patina doctor --audit`) with git-aware scanning that categorizes files by safety level and provides actionable cleanup suggestions. Fixed GitHub language stats issue (33% → 89% Rust) by marking tree-sitter grammars as vendored in `.gitattributes`. Merged PR #42 to main after fixing clippy warnings, with tool successfully identifying 587 MB of reclaimable space (old models, backups, and archives).

### 13:05 - Update (covering since 12:38)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 0
- Files changed: 5 (1 updated, 4 moved to dust)
- Last commit: 51 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**

1. **Reviewed Project Status** (30 minutes)
   - Read last 4 sessions to understand current state
   - Reviewed git history (20 commits since Nov 8)
   - Analyzed both planning documents (vision doc vs analysis doc)

2. **Synchronized Documentation** (20 minutes)
   - Updated `analysis-patina-current-truth-and-vision.md` with 3 missing sessions:
     - Session 20251116-194408: Model benchmarking, E5-base-v2 selection (+68%)
     - Session 20251116-223532: PR #41 platform variance (17 CI failures resolved)
     - Session 20251117-112022: File audit tool + repo cleanup
   - Added "Current Status Summary" section showing Topic 0 & Phase 0A/0B complete
   - Updated header date (Nov 13 → Nov 17) and status

3. **Cleaned Up Documentation Redundancy** (10 minutes)
   - Identified 4 overlapping neuro-symbolic vision docs in layer/surface/
   - Moved all to layer/dust/ with old- prefix:
     - old-neuro-symbolic-architecture-critique.md (30k)
     - old-neuro-symbolic-hybrid-extraction.md (17k)
     - old-neuro-symbolic-knowledge-system.md (40k)
     - old-patina-llm-driven-neuro-symbolic-knowledge-system.md (34k)
   - Result: `analysis-patina-current-truth-and-vision.md` is now single source of truth

**Key Decisions:**

1. **Clarified "No Divergence"**
   - User corrected confusion: Topic 0 + Phase 0A/0B were completed (not divergence)
   - Side work (model infra, PR #41, audit tool) was productive parallel work
   - Current state: Ready for Topic 1 (Retrieval Quality Baseline)

2. **Consolidated Documentation**
   - Analysis doc supersedes vision docs (comprehensive + current)
   - Vision docs archived as reference (event schemas, Prolog examples preserved)
   - Prevents confusion about which doc to follow

**Status:**
- ✅ Documentation synchronized and cleaned up
- ✅ Clear understanding of current state (Topic 0 complete, ready for Topic 1)
- ✅ Single source of truth established
