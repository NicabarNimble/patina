## Previous Session Context
The previous session identified significant behavioral differences between original and refactored scrape implementations - the refactor extracts 58% more functions and 11x more call relations. Fixed 6 critical bugs including database initialization and SQL injection vulnerabilities. Session ended with documentation acknowledging feature parity achieved but not behavioral parity.

## Goals
- [ ] stable-parsing-engine review and git updates

## Activity Log
### 17:49 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: stable-parsing-engine review and git updates
Working on branch: stable-parsing-engine
Tagged as: session-20250825-174912-start


### 21:08 - Update (covering since 17:49)

**Work Completed:**
- Reviewed 3 days of git history and stable-parsing-engine documentation
- Archived investigation docs (PARITY_INVESTIGATION, REFACTOR_FIXES, etc.) into DESIGN.md
- Consolidated documentation from 3 files (README, TODO, DESIGN) into single DESIGN.md
- Clarified the architecture: extraction engine is complete, context retrieval is next
- Preserved debugging scripts from parity investigation for future reference

**Key Insights:**
- The refactored scrape extracts 58% more functions and 11x more relationships - this is a feature not a bug
- We already have the query foundation in KnowledgeStore trait - just need orchestration layer
- Next step is building `patina context` command for natural language queries
