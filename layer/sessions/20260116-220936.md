## Previous Session Context
Previous session created PR #72 (epistemic layer, ref-repo storage, preflight cleanup). Fixed CI failures by ignoring `test_int8_model_loads` (requires downloaded model) and re-tracking `oxidize.yaml` (project recipe). All 232 tests passing locally, formatting and clippy clean.

## Goals
- [ ] pr keeps failing

### 22:16 - Update (covering since 22:09)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 0
- Last commit: 4 hours ago

**Work Completed:**
1. Started investigating PR #72 failure - could not access GitHub API (SSH auth issue)
2. Reviewed recent git history and session files to understand context
3. Confirmed `oxidize.yaml` was re-tracked in commit 4dbfd91f (was untracked in 036e9c64)
4. Reviewed CI pipeline (test.yml) - comprehensive checks including fmt, clippy, tests, release build, and retrieval quality benchmark

**Key Context:**
- PR #72 created in previous session with 40 commits (epistemic layer, ref-repo storage, preflight cleanup)
- Local checks passed in previous session: fmt, clippy, 232 tests
- Two CI fixes applied: ignored `test_int8_model_loads`, re-tracked `oxidize.yaml`
- GitHub CLI auth issue prevented checking actual PR status/failures

**Next Steps:**
- User will check PR status from another machine with working GitHub SSH
- Investigation paused pending actual CI failure details
