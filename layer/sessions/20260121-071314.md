## Previous Session Context
Last session "skills" was a deep exploration of specs, beliefs, and skills architecture. Key findings: traced the full belief flow (scrape layer → patterns → oxidize → usearch → scry), confirming beliefs ARE searchable. Mapped ~1900 lines of Nov 2025 neuro-symbolic code (storage/, reasoning/, query/semantic_search.rs) as true tech debt - a parallel implementation never integrated. Designed specs-as-skills pattern: folder structure as routing (feat/, fix/, refactor/), SPEC.md + design.md for progressive disclosure. No commits made.

## Goals
- [ ] Deep dive into `--help` to understand what's wired up vs not
- [ ] Identify code in the codebase that isn't connected to CLI commands

### 09:09 - Update (covering since 07:13)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 2
- Files changed: 7
- Last commit: 74 seconds ago

**Work Completed:**
1. Deep dive into `patina --help` - mapped all 22 CLI commands to src/commands/
2. Identified 1,715 lines of dead code: src/storage/, src/reasoning/, src/query/
3. Analyzed the Nov 2025 Prolog neuro-symbolic system - understood what it was trying to do
4. Compared Prolog approach (parallel system) vs current system (composition)
5. Discovered current belief confidence is "aspirational" - fake signals, no verification
6. Designed belief validation system using existing tools (scry, git, grep, wikilinks)
7. Created spec: layer/surface/build/feat/belief-validation-system/
8. Captured key insight as belief: compose-over-build

**Key Decisions:**
- Reject Prolog approach (parallel infrastructure requires separate maintenance)
- Adopt Prolog discipline (evidence thresholds, computed confidence)
- Use composition: scry for semantic verification, git for link verification, grep for content
- Improvements to underlying tools automatically improve belief validation

**Patterns Observed:**
- compose-over-build: Composed solutions improve when components improve; parallel systems don't
- Evidence links in beliefs ARE verifiable - sessions exist, content can be grep'd
- Current signals are fabricated: `EVIDENCE_SIGNAL=$(echo "$CONFIDENCE + 0.05" | bc)`

**Commits:**
- 636b83ed feat(epistemic): add belief validation system spec
- 9626d6f4 belief: add compose-over-build
