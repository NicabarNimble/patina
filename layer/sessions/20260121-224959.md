## Previous Session Context
Completed full removal of the `dev_env` subsystem (~490 lines of dead code across 26 files in 7 commits). Removed `patina build/test` commands, `--dev` flag from init, and devcontainer generation - redirecting users to `patina yolo`. Key insight captured as belief: "Refactoring specs require a read-code verification pass before implementation; static dependency tracing misses ~30% of affected paths."

## Goals
- [ ] Create PR from patina branch to main
- [ ] Verify CI passes
