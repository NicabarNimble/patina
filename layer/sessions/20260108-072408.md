## Previous Session Context
Last session (ref) fixed a PersonaOracle bug where it queried the wrong table (`beliefs` instead of `knowledge`) - now `[PERSONA]` results appear in hybrid scry. Ran Phase 0.25b temporal MRR benchmark (0.100, below target 0.4) and identified vocabulary mismatch as root cause (user says "commit message search", code uses "commits_fts"). Created `spec-vocabulary-gap.md` for LLM query expansion fix and thinned build/spec docs by ~735 lines. 4 commits merged.

## Goals
- [x] Fix patina binary being killed on launch

## Key Fix
**Root cause:** `ort` crate released 2.0.0-rc.11 with breaking API change. `cargo install` ignores Cargo.lock and resolved to the new version, causing build failures. A partial/corrupted install likely caused the "killed" behavior.

**Fix (commit 1655c065):**
1. Pinned `ort = "=2.0.0-rc.10"` in Cargo.toml
2. Added `cargo install --locked` to CI workflow
3. Added `cargo install --locked` to pre-push checks

**Reproducibility trifecta:** Cargo.lock in git (d123f88c) + `=` pins for RC crates + `--locked` flag in CI

### 08:46 - Update (covering since 07:24)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 1
- Files changed: 21
- Last commit: 31 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
1. Fixed `patina` binary being killed on launch - root cause was `ort` 2.0.0-rc.11 breaking API
2. Pinned `ort = "=2.0.0-rc.10"` to prevent cargo install from resolving to breaking version
3. Added `cargo install --locked` to CI and pre-push checks (reproducibility trifecta)
4. Restored `spec-code-audit.md` from git history (806 lines, Dec 2025 audit)
5. Created `spec-report.md` - self-analysis reports using patina's own tools
6. Wired spec-report into build.md (Active specs, Measurement Tools, Current Focus)
7. Fixed init failing on dirs with nested git repos - new `add_paths()` function
8. Improved git error messages to show actual stderr

**Key Decisions:**
- Report quality = tool quality (dogfooding as measurement)
- Manifest needed before deinit (track what patina created vs pre-existing)
- Jon Gjengset perspective: `--locked` should be the default for reproducibility

**Uncommitted:** spec-report.md, spec-code-audit.md, build.md updates, init fix for nested repos
