## Previous Session Context
Last session ("going") established Patina's versioning system for the go-public initiative. Created Phase.Milestone model (MAJOR.PHASE.MILESTONE) fitting milestone-driven development, bumped version to v0.8.1, and designed the `patina version` command to replace release-plz. Key decisions: sessions stay flat and committed (transparency is the feature), contributor field added to session metadata. Also decided session-end should prompt for version bumps.

## Goals
- [x] clawdbot facts vs fiction - deep dive comparison complete
- [x] repo-reliability spec - all 3 phases implemented and archived

### 16:17 - Update (covering since 14:11)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 6
- Files changed: 0
- Last commit: 53 seconds ago

**Work Completed:**
- Added clawdbot as reference repo via `patina repo add`
- Discovered `repo add` only runs scrape, not oxidize - semantic search unavailable
- Created repo-reliability spec anchored in core values (unix-philosophy, dependable-rust)
- Phase 1: Fixed Unicode panic in `dependency.rs:125` - byte slicing on multi-byte UTF-8
- Phase 2: Wired oxidize into `repo add` (default on, `--no-oxidize` to skip)
- Phase 3: Added `patina oxidize --repo <name>` convenience flag
- Archived completed spec via git tag `spec/repo-reliability`

**Key Decisions:**
- Oxidize runs by default on repo add (unix philosophy: one command, complete result)
- Oxidize failures warn but don't fail (scrape value exists without embeddings)
- Used `is_char_boundary()` for safe UTF-8 truncation (stable Rust, not nightly `floor_char_boundary`)
- Spec archived via tag, not moved to dust (code is the documentation once complete)

**Discussion Context:**
- Compared Patina vs Clawdbot architectures (skills, sessions, layer directories)
- Identified shared concepts: progressive disclosure, session tracking, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md
- Clawdbot has mature skill packaging (SKILL.md + frontmatter) - potential pattern for Patina

**Challenges Faced:**
- `oxidize --repo` flag didn't exist, had to `cd` to repo directory manually
- `oxidize.yaml` not scaffolded for repos - had to copy manually
- `floor_char_boundary` is unstable - used `is_char_boundary()` loop instead

**Patterns Observed:**
- "Read code before write code" prevents rework
- "Scalpel not shotgun" - one commit per logical change
- Specs anchored in core values guide implementation decisions


### 16:19 - Update (covering since 16:17)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 1
- Files changed: 0
- Last commit: 30 seconds ago

**Work Completed:**
- Archived completed spec via `git tag spec/repo-reliability` + delete
- Created epistemic belief `repo-add-complete-result` capturing the core design decision

**Key Decisions:**
- Option 1 for spec archival (tag + delete) over Option 2 (move to dust)
- Belief supports unix-philosophy, acknowledged performance concern as "Attacked-By"
