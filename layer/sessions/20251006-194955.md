## Previous Session Context
Successfully integrated Claude Code CLI into patina's YOLO devcontainers, enabling autonomous AI development inside containers. Fixed docker-compose build directives, implemented credential management mirroring cuti's isolation pattern (~/.patina/claude-linux), and validated full workflow: outer Claude → docker exec → inner Claude autonomously started Anvil blockchain. Confirmed Max subscription OAuth persists across container rebuilds via volume mounts.

## Goals
- [ ] understanding subagents om claude code

## Activity Log

### 20:31 - Update (covering since 19:49)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 1
- Last commit: 48 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
- Researched Claude Agent SDK architecture and subagent design patterns
- Read two Anthropic engineering articles on building agents and writing tools
- Documented core agent loop: gather context → take action → verify work → repeat
- Identified subagent benefits: parallelization and isolated context management
- Captured tool design principles: fewer consolidated tools, human-readable responses, token efficiency

**Key Decisions:**
- Research-only session, no code changes needed
- Focused on understanding subagent patterns for potential application to patina's architecture

**Patterns Observed:**
- Subagents provide context isolation - each maintains separate conversation without polluting main thread
- Tool consolidation principle: combine related operations (schedule_event vs separate list/create tools)
- "Give Claude a computer" philosophy aligns with patina's container-native approach
- Agent tools are non-deterministic unlike traditional software
- Tools should match human problem-solving patterns
