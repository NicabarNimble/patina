## Previous Session Context
In the last session on neuro-symbolic AI, I created a proof-of-concept persona system using Scryer Prolog with SQLite, manually extracting facts from 7 sessions into facts.pl and writing inference rules for pattern evolution. The session successfully merged the YOLO devcontainer generation feature to main (PR #36) after fixing CI issues, and documented Patina's complete architecture in a comprehensive 1,770-line reference document. Key unsolved challenge remains building the automated LLM extraction pipeline to replace manual fact extraction from session prose.

## Goals

### 09:23 - Update (covering since 06:44)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 1
- Last commit: 4 days ago

**Work Completed:**
- Reviewed git history showing successful SQLite migration from DuckDB (PRs #31-32)
- Analyzed 227+ session files structure and neuro-symbolic POC implementation
- Examined existing code database schema in `src/commands/scrape/code/database.rs`
- Studied comprehensive database design in `layer/buckets/patina-dev/DESIGN.md`
- Reviewed session knowledge schema proposal with 8 core tables
- Analyzed timeline support through timestamps and git integration

**Key Decisions:**
- Focus on database knowledge extraction from session history
- Identified SQLite as proven choice after DuckDB migration
- Session knowledge schema well-designed with proper relationships
- Timeline should track: session chronology, pattern evolution, tech adoption

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Challenge: Understanding full scope of existing implementation
- Solution: Systematic review of git history, sessions, and design docs
- Challenge: Determining timeline granularity needs
- Solution: Identified three levels - session, commit, and update

**Patterns Observed:**
- Pragmatic simplification: DuckDB → SQLite for better CI and simplicity
- Neuro-symbolic architecture: LLM extraction + Prolog inference
- Git as memory: Session tags enable pattern survival queries
- Schema mirrors session structure: Sections map directly to database tables
