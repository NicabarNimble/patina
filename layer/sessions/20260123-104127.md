## Previous Session Context
Last session reframed "release-plz fix" into the broader "go-public" initiative for preparing Patina for open source contributions. Created comprehensive spec at `layer/surface/build/feat/go-public/SPEC.md` (541 lines) with quality gate system: branch flow (patina→main), contributor verification (register/verify with hash), Patina-signed PRs via `patina pr create/push`, and 8 defense layers. Key insight: trust ladder model (new→proven→maintainer) with Patina as contribution interface where friction is a feature.

## Goals
- [x] going public - versioning system established

### 11:43 - Update (covering since 10:41)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 4
- Files changed: 6
- Last commit: spec(go-public): add session transparency, patina version command

**Work Completed:**
1. **Session Transparency Model** - Decided sessions are project artifacts (not personal). Flat structure with contributor attribution, like commits.
2. **Release Audit** - Analyzed 1,441 commits, identified v0.1.0 was tagged Dec 16, 2025 (not Jan as initially thought).
3. **Versioning Policy** - Created Phase.Milestone model (MAJOR.PHASE.MILESTONE) fitting milestone-driven development.
4. **Version History** - Retroactively assigned versions to 8 phases from bootstrap to go-public.
5. **Version Bump** - Updated Cargo.toml from 0.1.0 to 0.8.1.
6. **Replace release-plz** - Designed `patina version` command (show/milestone/phase) with session-end integration.

**Key Decisions:**
- Sessions stay flat and committed (transparency is the feature)
- Contributor field added to session metadata
- release-plz removed in favor of Patina-native versioning
- v0.8.1 = Phase 8 (Go Public), Milestone 1 (versioning established)

**Patterns Observed:**
- Phase.Milestone model fits burst development + milestone completions
- Session-end prompt for version bump addresses "keeping up" fear
- Spec artifacts pattern (folder with SPEC.md + supporting docs) scales well
