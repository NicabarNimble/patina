## Previous Session Context
The previous session successfully created unit tests for core modules (Layer, Session, Version, Environment) with 41 tests passing. All 66 clippy warnings were fixed, establishing a clean baseline. The session ended after context compaction, with GitHub Actions setup identified as the next priority task.

## Goals
- [ ] continue with our test implementations

## Activity Log
### 18:09 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: continue with our test implementations


### 18:52 - Update (covering since 18:09)

**Work completed**:
- Created basic GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/test.yml)
- Fixed formatting issues across codebase
- Successfully merged PR#1 with passing CI checks
- Set up GitHub branch protection rules for main branch
- Verified testing guide already exists and is comprehensive
- Fixed recurring hook issue by removing .claude/settings.json

**Key decisions**:
- Kept CI simple initially - just Rust tests, no Dagger yet
- Named workflow "Test Pipeline" for clarity
- Protected main branch with required status checks
- Chose "Main Branch Protection" as ruleset name

**Challenges faced**:
- Formatting issues discovered when testing workflow locally
- Had to wait for GitHub to recognize "Test Suite" status check
- Zombie hook kept returning - finally tracked to .claude/settings.json

**Patterns observed**:
- GitHub Actions + branch protection creates professional workflow
- Testing guide was already complete from previous work
- Hook issues can persist across sessions in config files
- Phase 1 of testing implementation now fully complete
