## Previous Session Context
The previous session focused on scraping Patina's metal-themed architecture, extracting and documenting the metal metaphor that runs through the project. Two commits were made to capture pattern work, with changes to 5 files including pattern documentation.

## Goals
- [ ] scrape patina metal design explained

## Activity Log

### 23:23 - Update (covering since 22:01)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        0
- Files changed: 7
- Last commit: 2 hours ago

**Work completed:**
- Created condensed version of patina-metal architecture documentation (`patina-metal-explained.md`)
- Reduced 786 lines to 130 lines, focusing on current state vs historical narrative
- Researched WASM alternative discussion from previous sessions
- Analyzed Solidity parameter extraction fix to understand if WASM would have helped (it wouldn't)

**Key decisions:**
- Discovered Slang by Nomic Foundation as superior Solidity parser alternative
  - 4x faster than tree-sitter-solidity, supports 80+ Solidity versions
  - Written in Rust with `slang_solidity` crate available
  - Actively maintained by Hardhat team
- Investigated syn-solidity (Foundry) and other alternatives
- Confirmed tree-sitter-solidity (JoranHonig) is essentially unmaintained with no viable forks

**Challenges faced:**
- Tree-sitter-solidity parameter extraction issues are grammar-level, not distribution issues
- No real tree-sitter alternatives exist for Solidity
- Maintaining a tree-sitter grammar from Slang would be backwards and complex

**Patterns observed:**
- Best tools for the job principle: Use Slang for Solidity, keep tree-sitter for other languages
- Pragmatic approach: Build parallel implementation to compare before switching
- The patina-metal abstraction successfully isolates parser complexity from main codebase
