## Previous Session Context
Major architecture evolution in last session: adopted "scrape existing logs" model (git, sessions, code ARE logs), designed multi-user architecture (events+recipe git-tracked, data gitignored, personas personal), and created recipe model for adapters (share `oxidize.yaml`, build locally). Rewrote build.md with 6-phase pipeline, created new specs (scrape-pipeline, oxidize), and removed obsolete event-foundation spec.

## Goals
- [ ] build

## Activity Log
### 11:31 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: build
Working on branch: neuro-symbolic-knowledge-system
Tagged as: session-20251121-113107-start


### 11:51 - Update (covering since 11:31)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 0
- Files changed: 3
- Last commit: 22 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
1. Reviewed recent sessions (20251121-065812) and git history
2. Read build.md and verified linked specs
3. Found missing `spec-scry.md` - created it with full implementation details
4. Analyzed alignment between build pipeline and layer/core docs
5. Identified divergence in `oxidized-knowledge.md` from persona model
6. Rewrote `oxidized-knowledge.md` to reflect project/persona separation

**Key Decisions:**
- Created spec-scry.md rather than removing reference from build.md
- Updated oxidized-knowledge.md (option 1) rather than archiving to dust

**Files Modified:**
- `layer/surface/spec-scry.md` (new) - scry query interface spec
- `layer/core/oxidized-knowledge.md` - added Knowledge Separation, updated Data Flow diagram

**Patterns Observed:**
- Core docs need periodic alignment checks as architecture evolves
- The oxidation metaphor still works with project/persona split


### 12:06 - Update (covering since 11:51)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 0
- Files changed: 3
- Last commit: 37 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
1. Fixed `/session-end` command to check for recent updates
2. Logic now in command prompt (not bash script): check `.last-update`, if > 2 mins run update first
3. Reverted bash script changes, updated command prompts in both resources/ and .claude/
4. Verified resources and .claude versions match

**Key Decisions:**
- Keep time-check logic in command prompt, not bash script (cleaner separation)
- 2 minute threshold for "recent" update

**Files Modified:**
- `resources/claude/.claude/commands/session-end.md` - new logic
- `.claude/commands/session-end.md` - synced
