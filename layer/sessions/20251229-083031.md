**LLM**: claude
**Git Branch**: patina
**Session Tag**: session-20251229-083031-start
**Starting Commit**: 4d39c6ea55d2b3546601c34ea36562b9af78f443

## Previous Session Context
Last session (pr) successfully created and merged PR #69 into main. The PR included the release-plz crate rename fix (changing `[package] name` to "patina-ai" to avoid crates.io collision with existing UEFI SDK) plus the assay modularization work (8 commits total). Local main was synced with GitHub and the patina branch remains active for continued development.

## Goals
- [x] Define three-layer architecture (mother/patina/awaken)
- [x] Create spec-three-layers.md as north star
- [x] Update spec-architectural-alignment.md to reference north star

## Activity Log
### 08:30 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: spec-architectural-alignment
Working on branch: patina
Tagged as: session-20251229-083031-start

### 08:30-10:00 - Architecture Discovery Session

**Deep exploration of:**
- layer/core values (dependable-rust, unix-philosophy)
- spec-architectural-alignment.md (current refactoring plans)
- spec-pipeline.md (knowledge pipeline)
- Current command structure and code organization

**Key realization:**
Patina is part of a larger system that hasn't been built yet:
- **Mother** (formerly "mothership") = Persona/orchestration layer
- **Patina** = Knowledge layer (RAG with evolving knowledge)
- **Awaken** (formerly "yolo") = Action/deployment layer

**Naming journey:**
- Explored metal/metallurgy themes (forge, crucible, anvil)
- Explored organic/mythical themes (familiar, conjure, grove)
- Explored sci-fi/hive themes (mothership, spawn, spore)
- Landed on Dan Simmons Hyperion-inspired narrative
- Final trinity: **mother / patina / awaken**

**The narrative:**
> "Mother watches from orbit. Patina spreads to every project she touches - marking them, connecting them, carrying their souls back to her. When she calls, the marked projects awaken."

**Artifacts created:**
- `layer/surface/build/spec-three-layers.md` - North star architecture doc
- Updated `spec-architectural-alignment.md` to reference north star

**Key decisions:**
- Three separate binaries from one crate (patina-ai)
- `mother` = user identity, central command (~/.patina/)
- `patina` = project knowledge (project/.patina/)
- `awaken [PROJECT] <action>` = smart resolution CLI for deployment
- Option C chosen for awaken: project optional, smart resolution

### 10:00 - Session End

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 0 (documentation/spec work, no code changes)
- Files created: 1 (spec-three-layers.md)
- Files modified: 2 (spec-architectural-alignment.md, active-session.md)

**Work Completed:**
- Deep architectural discovery session
- Defined three-layer architecture: mother / patina / awaken
- Created north star spec document (spec-three-layers.md)
- Updated architectural alignment spec with north star reference

**Key Insight:**
Patina is the knowledge layer in a larger system. The trinity of mother/patina/awaken provides clear separation of concerns while maintaining the sci-fi narrative that makes the system memorable and intuitive.
