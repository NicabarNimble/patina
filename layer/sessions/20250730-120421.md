## Previous Session Context
The previous session successfully reorganized the layer/ documentation structure into domain-based topics, merged PR #3, and fixed formatting issues in PR #2. However, clippy warnings about format strings were noted and need to be addressed in this session.

## Goals
- [x] clippy PR #2 issue fix

## Activity Log
### 12:04 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: clippy PR #2 issue fix


### 13:11 - Update (covering since 12:04)

**Work completed:**
- Fixed all clippy warnings in PR #2:
  - Resolved format string warnings by converting to inline format variables (`{variable}` syntax instead of positional arguments)
  - Fixed single-match warning by replacing `match` with `if let` in workspace status command
- Applied cargo fmt for consistent code formatting
- Successfully merged PR #2 which added Go Dagger workspace functionality

**Key decisions:**
- Used inline format variables (`println!("{path}")`) instead of positional arguments (`println!("{}", path)`) to follow modern Rust idioms
- Replaced single-pattern match expressions with `if let` for cleaner, more idiomatic code
- Maintained CI compliance throughout the fixes

**Challenges faced:**
- Initial clippy warnings were blocking PR #2 merge
- Had to ensure all format strings used the modern inline variable syntax
- Solution: Systematically updated all format strings in affected files (dagger.rs, workspace_client.rs, workspace.rs)

**Patterns observed:**
- Clippy's format string lints push toward more readable, modern Rust patterns
- Using inline format variables reduces cognitive load and potential errors
- CI integration (clippy in GitHub Actions) effectively enforces code quality standards
- Small, focused commits for each type of fix make PR review easier

**Next steps:**
- Session goal completed ✓ - PR #2 is now merged with all clippy issues resolved
