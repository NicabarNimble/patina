## Previous Session Context
Last session ("clawdbot") completed the repo-reliability spec in 3 phases: fixed a Unicode panic in `dependency.rs:125` (byte slicing on multi-byte UTF-8), wired oxidize into `repo add` by default, and added `patina oxidize --repo <name>` convenience flag. Also added clawdbot as a reference repo and began comparing Patina vs Clawdbot architectures - identified shared concepts (progressive disclosure, session tracking, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md) and noted Clawdbot's mature skill packaging (SKILL.md + frontmatter) as a potential pattern. Archived the spec via git tag and captured the "repo-add-complete-result" belief.

## Goals
- [ ] clawdbot facts vs fiction - continue deep dive comparison

### 20:15 - Update (covering since 17:26)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session: 4
- Files changed: 1
- Last commit: 10 minutes ago

**Work Completed:**
- Re-added clawdbot as reference repo (was missing from registry)
- Deep dive comparison of Patina vs Clawdbot architectures
- Created comparison report documenting facts vs fiction
- Discovered `patina report` exists but only for project state, not cross-project comparison
- Created new spec folder `explore/clawdbot-patterns/` with SPEC.md + research.md
- Identified 4 patterns to test: multi-agent safety, workflow runbooks, SKILL.md frontmatter, learnings in skills
- Added rejection criteria, triggers, and completion definition to spec

**Key Decisions:**
- Reports belong with their spec (research.md moved from reports/compare/ to spec folder)
- External patterns need validation before adoption - "read it in another repo" isn't evidence
- SKILL.md frontmatter can proceed (validated by agentskills.io external standard)
- Other patterns need opportunistic testing with measurable rejection criteria

**Discussion Context:**
- Andrew Ng principle: don't build what you can't measure
- Clawdbot is swiss-army-knife personal assistant, Patina is enterprise-focused context orchestration
- Shared patterns worth stealing: skill packaging, multi-agent safety protocols

**Patterns Observed:**
- Spec folder format: `SPEC.md` + supporting files (design.md, research.md)
- Research/reports should live with their driving spec for lifecycle management
