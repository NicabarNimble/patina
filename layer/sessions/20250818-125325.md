## Previous Session Context
Last session focused on connecting Patina's existing git functions, exploring how to integrate git commands with the pattern management system. The work examined git command review and integration planning to enhance Patina's memory capabilities through version control.

## Goals
- [ ] git integration plan review

## Activity Log
### 12:53 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: git integration plan review


### 13:49 - Update (covering since session start)

**Work Completed:**
- Reviewed all git integration documentation and code
- Identified and removed confusing standalone `/git-*` commands
- Created new `/session-git-*` commands as testing versions
- Successfully integrated commands into Patina binary
- Tested `patina init .` re-initialization process
- Verified session preservation through multiple re-inits

**Key Decisions:**
- Removed standalone git commands to reduce confusion
- Implemented session-git commands as enhanced versions with git integration
- Following "Information over Automation" philosophy
- Testing strategy: parallel commands before migration

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Initial confusion about command design → Reviewed flow docs in layer/surface/commands/
- Commands not appearing after build → Needed to `cargo install --path .`
- Understanding init process → Verified all components working correctly

**Patterns Observed:**
- Patina's init process is robust and preserves context
- Git integration as context engineering, not just version control
- Session branches as permanent memory, never deleted
- Testing parallel commands before migration is wise
