**LLM**: claude
**Git Branch**: neuro-symbolic-knowledge-system
**Session Tag**: session-20251108-075248-start
**Starting Commit**: 93ab80060e106e85236ad9de56df1b3f86d10a49

## Previous Session Context
Completed comprehensive neuro-symbolic knowledge system design with 8 major work items: created 45KB vision document defining persona/project duality, designed git-based event sourcing architecture, and made critical decision to use emergent domain tags (not databases) where LLM auto-tags during scrape and discovers relationships during oxidize. Identified gaps in 260 untapped sessions and need for extraction tracking. Next: Phase 1 implementation with database schema, scrape command structure, and session markdown parser.

### 13:45 - Major Design Reframing & Doc Rewrite

**Context Review**:
- Reviewed git history (last 20 commits): Phase 2.7 complete, PR #40 merged
- Read recent sessions: 20251106-140838 (PR merge), 20251107-061130 (observation extraction), 20251107-124740 (neuro-symbolic design)
- Read two design docs: patina-llm-driven-neuro-symbolic-knowledge-system.md (45KB, v2) and git-event-sourced-multi-persona-architecture.md

**Critical Design Discussion**:
- User asked about domains: "we use tags for domains? they emerge from observations?"
- Clarified: Phase 3 marked "INTEGRATED" means design integrated, not code implemented
- Current reality: No domains field in observations.db yet, 463 observations exist
- Domains are designed (auto-tagging, co-occurrence), not yet built

**First-Principles Reframing**:
User provided critical insight: "AI observes, AI records, AI + User reason, AI records for best knowledge retrieval by AI. Output is AI and user collaboration. Goal: AI becomes fully immersed into persona so user and AI become interchangeable. This is done via framework of memory and rules so the LLM can be interchangeable."

Key corrections to my understanding:
1. **Not real-time watching** - Git-like batch processing (explicit capture points: git commits, /session-note, /session-update)
2. **Real-time matters for retrieval** - Not yet built, future work
3. **Events = organization** - Just a data structure, don't overthink
4. **Manual triggers are good** - Lean into session capture + git details
5. **LLM interchangeability = adapters** - `patina init --llm=claude|gemini`, framework is LLM-agnostic
6. **Persona ≠ "you"** - Persona is any set of beliefs/rules/facts (user, Einstein, team style)
7. **Mac-centric = design constraint** - Not fully realized yet
8. **Event sourcing + domains from start** - Can't waste time building then changing

**Migration Path Agreed**:
- Backup existing databases (not git tracked)
- Start fresh with event-sourced structure
- 4-week Phase 1: 1A (Event Foundation), 1B (Session Scraping), 1C (Git Scraping), 1D (Oxidize & Integration)

**Complete Doc Rewrite**:
Rewrote patina-llm-driven-neuro-symbolic-knowledge-system.md (v2 → v3):
- **Trimmed**: 981 lines → 915 lines (removed verbosity, kept substance)
- **Reframed**: "What We're Building" - persona is permanent, LLM is ephemeral
- **Structured**: 4 parts (Input, Storage, Validation, Loading) not "Five Pillars"
- **Event-sourced**: Flow diagram, event file format, materialization process
- **Domains as tags**: Schema with auto-tagging during scrape, relationships during oxidize
- **Phase 1 focus**: 4-week breakdown with concrete tasks, success criteria
- **Future phases**: Summarized (not detailed specs)

**Document Review Structure Added**:
Created 10-topic review framework embedded in doc:
- Deep Dive: Topics 2 (Event Sourcing), 3 (Domains), 7 (Phase 1), 5 (Persona/Project)
- Medium Dive: Topics 1 (Vision), 4 (Neuro-Symbolic), 6 (Current→Target)
- Light Review: Topics 8 (Success Metrics), 10 (Principles), 9 (Future Phases)
- Recommended review order: 2, 3, 7, 5, 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9
- Checklist for tracking review status

**Next Sessions**:
Will review and refine doc topic-by-topic:
- Topic 2 (Event Sourcing Foundation) - first priority
- Fine-tune and expand each topic
- Ensure Phase 1 implementation plan is concrete

**Key Decisions**:
✅ Event sourcing from start (observations are immutable events)
✅ Domains as tags (auto-tagged by LLM during scrape)
✅ Scrape separate from oxidize (extraction vs vectorization)
✅ Shared/local split (git-committed vs gitignored)
✅ Backup and start fresh (existing 463 observations backed up)
✅ Git-like batch processing (not real-time watching)
✅ Obsidian-compatible markdown (adapt as needed)
