# Session: layer indexer as gps discuss and build
**ID**: 20250802-113539
**Started**: 2025-08-02T15:35:39Z
**LLM**: claude

## Previous Session Context
The previous session focused on exploring and evolving the layer architecture. Key work included examining the existing layer structure and session management patterns. The session ended with the creation of a comprehensive layer session summary documenting insights about patterns, topics, and project organization.

## Goals
- [ ] layer indexer as gps discuss and build

## Activity Log
### 11:35 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: layer indexer as gps discuss and build

### 11:45 - Update (covering since 11:35)

**Work completed:**
- Reviewed last session's indexer design breakthroughs (GPS navigation, not search)
- Analyzed Torii (Dojo blockchain indexer) architecture for comparison
- Key insight: "Torii indexes state, Patina indexes knowledge"
- Explored integration of live blockchain data into Patina domains
- Designed federated domain architecture for knowledge sharing
- Created layer/surface/domain-architecture.md documenting domain protocol
- Verified core docs have no contradictions, properly narrow in scope

**Key decisions:**
- Each Patina domain is a complete, self-contained knowledge tool
- Domains can optionally federate to share knowledge
- Indexer remains "dumb" - just navigates, doesn't process data
- Data adapters in domains handle external sources (blockchain, APIs)
- Local-first with multiplayer capabilities when connected

**Breakthrough insights:**
- Patina as universal protocol for actionable LLM knowledge
- Domains are independent but can form knowledge networks
- Unix philosophy extends to domain independence
- Knowledge locality: most knowledge is domain-specific

**Patterns observed:**
- Separation of concerns: navigation (indexer) vs data processing (adapters)
- Progressive complexity: single domain → templates → federation
- Tool agnostic at every level (LLM, environment, data sources)
