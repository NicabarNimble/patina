# Session: git commands review
**ID**: 20250815-192355
**Started**: 2025-08-15T23:23:55Z
**LLM**: claude

## Previous Session Context
Last session implemented separate Git memory commands (git-start, git-update, git-end, git-note) to experiment with Git integration without breaking the existing session system. The approach focuses on "Information over Automation" - providing Git context and memory to LLMs rather than forcing workflows. Documentation was added for each command following proper project structure.

## Goals
- [ ] git commands review

## Activity Log
### 19:23 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: git commands review


### 20:16 - Update (covering since session start)

**Work Completed:**
- Reviewed GitHub changes from other device - git commands added to Claude adapter init
- Deep dive into git command implementations (git-start, git-update, git-note, git-end)
- Comprehensive documentation updates to CLAUDE.md and PROJECT_DESIGN.toml
- Fixed outdated information, reflected current architecture
- Successfully tested git memory commands after patina init
- Created PR #15 and merged to main

**Key Decisions & Reasoning:**
- Changed Patina type from "tool" to "system" - it helps build systems with LLMs
- Focused on "Information over Automation" philosophy for Git integration
- Pattern-selection-framework is the north star, actual code tells the truth
- Removed redundant pattern mentions and outdated dependencies

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Challenge: Session files lost during `patina init .`
- Solution: Restored from backup, discovered preservation bug
- Challenge: Documentation had outdated info (tokio, old patterns)
- Solution: Updated to reflect actual implementation

**Patterns Observed:**
- Git memory commands successfully embedded in Claude adapter
- Backup system works but has gaps (active-session.md not preserved)
- Documentation drift happens quickly - need regular reviews
- Pattern-selection-framework properly guides architecture decisions
