# Session: learn new git commands
**ID**: 20250815-202100

**LLM**: claude

## Previous Session Context
Last session completed a comprehensive review of the Git memory commands (git-start, git-update, git-note, git-end) that were added to the Claude adapter. The documentation was updated to reflect the current architecture and the "Information over Automation" philosophy for Git integration. All changes were merged to main via PR #15 after successful testing.

## Goals
- [ ] learn new git commands

## Activity Log
### 20:21 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: learn new git commands


### 13:55 - Update (covering since 20:21)

**Work Completed:**
- Deep dive into existing Git integration architecture (state machine, detection, indexer)
- Created comprehensive Git integration documentation (4 new docs in layer/surface/)
- Implemented hook command infrastructure in Patina (src/commands/hook.rs)
- Added CLI support for `patina hook` command
- Moved work from main to feature branch (feat/git-hooks-integration)
- Identified disconnect: 80% complete Git system but not connected

**Key Decisions & Reasoning:**
- Hooks call Patina commands (universal tooling) not custom scripts
- Keep existing session/git commands, add hooks as triggers
- Use "git like a scalpel" - small focused changes, commit often
- Feature branch for development, keep main clean

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Challenge: Complex Git systems not talking to each other
- Solution: Simple hook commands that bridge the gap
- Challenge: LLM-agnostic approach needed
- Solution: Patina as universal tool that any LLM's hooks can call

**Patterns Observed:**
- Patina has sophisticated Git infrastructure already built
- The problem isn't missing features but missing connections
- Confidence scoring uses commit status instead of survival time
- Git state machine exists but never receives events
