## Previous Session Context
The previous session focused on fixing the session capture system. The session file structure and commands were refined, but the full implementation details were not captured in the available context. This session continues that work to finalize the session file edits.

## Goals
- [ ] final edits of session files

## Activity Log
### 22:24 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: final edits of session files


### 22:48 - Update (covering since 22:24)

**Work completed:**
- Reviewed and identified issues in session scripts and templates
- Fixed session-start.sh to always prompt for todos (not conditional on previous session)
- Removed broken content-capture agent references from session-update.sh
- Updated session-end.sh to remove auto-update (now manual control via template)
- Rewrote all markdown templates for clarity and consistency
- Synchronized resource files with production .claude directory
- Bumped adapter version to 0.5.0 with comprehensive changelog

**Key decisions:**
- Claude should control workflow through markdown templates, not scripts doing things automatically
- Removed distillation from session-end to follow "capture raw, distill later" principle
- Session-update directly prompts for content instead of invoking non-existent agents
- Two-step session end: manual update first, then archive

**Challenges faced:**
- Discovered mismatch between resource files and production .claude files
- Update command issues meant manual file sync was needed
- Agent references were breaking session-update functionality

**Patterns observed:**
- Clear separation between script automation and Claude actions improves workflow
- Simple is better - removing complex agent invocations for direct prompts
- Version tracking in adapter helps manage changes across installations
