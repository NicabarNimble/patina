## Previous Session Context
The previous session focused on continuing Git integration work in the Patina project. The work involved implementing and refining Git-integrated session commands for better development workflow tracking.

## Goals
- [ ] Test and validate the session-git-start command functionality
- [ ] Ensure Git integration is working properly with session tracking
- [ ] Verify session tagging and branch management

## Activity Log
### 05:58 - Session Start
Session initialized with goal: session-git-start
Working on branch: work

### 09:02 - Update (covering since 05:58)

**Git Activity:**
- Commits this session:        1
- Files changed: 0
- Last commit: 9 seconds ago

**Work completed:**
- Verified session-git-start command created proper Git tags
- Reviewed last 2 days of session history to understand Git integration evolution
- Deep dive into session-git-integration-fix.md document
- Identified that SQLite metrics storage is already implemented in session-git-end.sh
- Discovered past bug with workspace_id format (now fixed)
- Committed verification work

**Key decisions and reasoning:**
- Used "scalpel not shotgun" approach - focusing on Step 3 completion
- Decided to verify existing implementation before making changes
- Found that metrics storage was already implemented (lines 125-160)

**Challenges faced and solutions:**
- Initial assumption that SQLite storage was missing
- Solution: Careful code review revealed it's already implemented
- Found evidence of past bug in workspace_id format that's been fixed

**Patterns observed:**
- Documentation sometimes lags implementation
- SQLite integration uses state_transitions table as multi-purpose storage
- Session system evolved from complex (branches) to simple (tags)
