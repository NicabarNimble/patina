# Patina - Oxidized Knowledge

**Purpose:** Define the conceptual model of how knowledge accumulates, transforms, and evolves within a development system.

---

## The Metaphor

Like metal developing a patina over time, knowledge in software development accumulates through exposure to problems, solutions, and experience. This patina protects and enriches the underlying system.

### Structure

**Core** - The base metal
- Immutable, proven patterns
- Load-bearing principles that support everything else
- Refined through repeated successful application

**Surface** - Active oxidation layer
- Where new patterns form through current work
- Malleable and experimental
- The interface between creativity and structure

**Dust** - Patina that has flaked off
- Archived wisdom that served its purpose
- Searchable history of what was tried
- Lessons learned from failed experiments

### System Roles

**User** - The Oxidizer
- Brings the oxygen of creativity and vision
- Asks the questions that drive transformation
- Provides the context and constraints that shape solutions

**LLMs** - The Smith
- Reads and interprets the accumulated patina
- Shapes raw patterns into working implementations
- Cannot create vision but can manifest it

**Sessions** - Chemical Reactions
- Where user vision meets LLM capability
- Capture the transformation as it happens
- Record both process and product

**Version Control** - Time
- The thread that weaves patterns together
- Provides proof of evolution
- Links cause to effect across iterations

**Isolation** - Controlled Environments
- Test chambers for new reactions
- Prevent contamination between experiments
- Enable reproducible transformations

## The Flow

Knowledge flows through predictable transformations:

```
Vision → Implementation → Capture → Validation → Integration
  ↓           ↓              ↓           ↓            ↓
Intent    Manifestation   Context    Evidence    Knowledge
```

Each stage transforms the previous:
- Vision becomes code through implementation
- Implementation becomes context through capture
- Context becomes evidence through validation
- Evidence becomes knowledge through integration

## Layer Dynamics

### Promotion Principles

**Surface → Core**
- Pattern proves valuable across multiple contexts
- Solves a recurring problem elegantly
- Becomes load-bearing for other patterns

**Surface → Dust**
- Pattern solved a specific problem once
- Superseded by better approach
- Failed to generalize but taught a lesson

### Layer Properties

**Core patterns are:**
- Immutable once proven
- Referenced but not modified
- The foundation others build upon

**Surface patterns are:**
- Actively evolving
- Open to experimentation
- The working edge of knowledge

**Dust patterns are:**
- Historical artifacts
- Searchable for context
- Reminders of paths explored

## System Properties

The system maintains essential properties through all transformations:

**Accumulation** - Knowledge only grows, never shrinks
- Even failures become dust (lessons)
- All paths explored leave traces
- The patina thickens over time

**Isolation** - Experiments don't contaminate each other
- Each reaction happens in its own chamber
- Failed experiments don't corrupt the core
- Success can be reproduced

**Traceability** - Every pattern has a story
- Origin session is recorded
- Evolution path is visible
- Success metrics are captured

**Discoverability** - All knowledge remains accessible
- Active patterns guide current work
- Historical patterns provide context
- Failed patterns prevent repetition

## The Paradox

The system's greatest strength is also its challenge: it can only capture patterns that emerge from use, not patterns that might be useful. The User (Oxidizer) must provide the creative spark - the system can only:

- Preserve what emerges
- Recognize repetition
- Suggest based on history
- Enforce proven patterns

This is why the User remains essential: they bring the vision that no amount of accumulated knowledge can generate. The patina enriches the metal, but someone must shape it into tools.

## Evolution

As the patina thickens:
- Core patterns become architectural principles
- Surface patterns reveal emerging abstractions
- Dust patterns highlight evolution paths
- The system becomes opinionated through experience

The goal is not to eliminate the need for creativity but to make each creative act build upon all previous ones. The patina doesn't replace the craftsman - it makes their tools better with each use.
