# Layer Architecture

Patina organizes knowledge in three layers: core, surface, and dust.

## The Pattern

**Core** - Implemented patterns you can grep for in code
**Surface** - Active work and emerging patterns  
**Dust** - Valuable archive of deprecated knowledge

## Implementation

Patterns move through layers based on use:
- Surface → Core (proven patterns)
- Core/Surface → Dust (deprecated patterns)

## Consequences

- Clear lifecycle for knowledge
- Automatic organization by relevance
- Natural pruning of outdated patterns
- Scalable from project to career
