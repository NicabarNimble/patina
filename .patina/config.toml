# Current embedding model (must match a model in resources/models/registry.toml)
model = "all-minilm-l6-v2"  # Default: fast, general-purpose

# To switch models:
# 1. Change this value to another model name (e.g., "bge-base-en-v1-5")
# 2. Run: patina embeddings generate --force
# 3. Test with: patina query semantic "your query"

# Available models (see resources/models/registry.toml for details):
# - all-minilm-l6-v2     (384 dims, 23MB, baseline)
# - bge-small-en-v1-5    (384 dims, 32MB, better retrieval, Phase 0A test candidate)
# - bge-base-en-v1-5     (768 dims, 105MB, SOTA, requires LFS)
# - e5-base-v2           (768 dims, 105MB, strong for questions, requires LFS)
# - gte-base             (768 dims, 105MB, balanced, requires LFS)
