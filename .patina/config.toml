# Current embedding model (must match a model in resources/models/registry.toml)
model = "all-minilm-l6-v2"  # Default: fast, general-purpose

# To switch models:
# 1. Change this value to another model name (e.g., "bge-base-en-v1-5")
# 2. Run: patina embeddings generate --force
# 3. Test with: patina query semantic "your query"

# Available models (see resources/models/registry.toml for details):
# - all-minilm-l6-v2   (384 dims, fast, current default)
# - bge-base-en-v1-5   (768 dims, SOTA for retrieval)
# - e5-base-v2         (768 dims, strong for questions)
# - gte-base           (768 dims, balanced)
