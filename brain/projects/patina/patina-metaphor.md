# Patina: The Metaphor and Mission

## The Beautiful Layer That Forms Through Use

Just like the patina on copper or bronze that develops through exposure and time, **Patina** accumulates programming wisdom through actual use. Each project, each session with Claude, each problem solved adds another layer to this protective, beautiful coating of knowledge.

## The Core Metaphor

**Patina** (the tool) creates **patina** (accumulated wisdom):
- Every time you solve a problem, it oxidizes into permanent knowledge
- The more you use it, the richer and more protective it becomes
- Each project adds its own unique coloring to the overall patina
- The patina transfers - touch it to new projects and they begin with that protective layer

## What Patina Really Is

```
Developer + LLM + Accumulated Patina = Accelerated Creation
```

Patina is how your programming wisdom accumulates and transfers through AI-assisted development. It's a tool that ensures every problem you solve with an LLM becomes tomorrow's solved problem.

## The Process in Action

### Building a Game
When you want to build a game:
1. **Patina** connects you to Claude with all your accumulated wisdom
2. Claude can reference past game patterns, physics solutions, rendering approaches
3. As you build, new discoveries oxidize into the patina
4. Dagger agents can explore possibilities using the same patina

### The Agent System
```rust
// Agent has access to your patina
let agent = patina.spawn_agent("explore-physics-engines");
agent.context(my_patina_layer);
agent.explore(); // Uses accumulated wisdom to try approaches
```

The agent isn't just randomly trying things - it's working from your accumulated patina, knowing what's worked before, what hasn't, what patterns apply.

## Terminology Aligned with the Metaphor

- **Patina Layer**: Your accumulated wisdom (the beautiful coating)
- **Base Metal**: Raw project (what you're building)
- **Oxidation**: The process of experience becoming wisdom
- **Transfer**: Applying patina to new projects
- **Alloy**: Mixing your patina with team/community patina
- **Polish**: Refining patterns through repeated use
- **Tarnish**: Anti-patterns to avoid (also valuable knowledge)

## The Mission

Enable developers to:
1. **Accumulate** - Every coding session adds to your patina
2. **Transfer** - New projects start with accumulated wisdom
3. **Accelerate** - Build faster with each project
4. **Share** - Alloy your patina with others

## Why This Matters

Traditional development: Every project starts from scratch, re-learning the same lessons.

With Patina: Every project starts with all the wisdom from every project before it. Your thousandth project has the accumulated patina of all 999 before it.

## The End State

A developer with years of Patina has:
- Instant access to every pattern that's worked
- Awareness of every approach that's failed
- Context-aware AI that knows their style
- Ability to spin up agents with full context
- A beautiful, rich patina that makes every new project easier

**Patina: Your code wisdom, accumulated and accessible.**
