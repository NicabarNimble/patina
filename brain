# Brain → Layer Migration

The `brain/` directory has been renamed to `layer/` to better align with the Patina metaphor.

**New location**: `layer/`

The "layer" terminology better represents how wisdom accumulates like patina on metal - each session and pattern adds to your protective layer of knowledge.

See `layer/` for all patterns and documentation.
