# Core Principles

These principles are immutable and guide every decision in Patina (codename).

## Unix Philosophy
- **One tool, one job, done well**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Composable components
- Text as universal interface

## Rust Patterns
- **Ownership and borrowing** - Clear ownership of data and responsibilities
- **Type safety** - Use the type system to enforce correctness
- **Explicit over implicit** - Make intentions clear
- **Zero-cost abstractions** - Performance without compromise

## Architecture Principles
- **Test abstractions against three paradigms** - Ensure flexibility
- **Think slowly, implement carefully** - Architecture decisions are costly to change
- **Separate core from adapters** - Keep the heart of the system pure
- **Context is king** - Everything serves the goal of maintaining consistent context

## Development Philosophy
- **Listen first** - Understand the problem before proposing solutions
- **User's patterns first** - Respect existing workflows and preferences
- **Progressive disclosure** - Simple things simple, complex things possible
- **Documentation is context** - Today's code is tomorrow's context

## AI Collaboration
- **LLM agnostic** - Work with any AI assistant
- **Context over prompts** - Rich context enables better AI performance
- **Rails not restrictions** - Guide AI behavior without limiting capability
- **Human wisdom + AI capability** - Amplify human expertise, don't replace it
